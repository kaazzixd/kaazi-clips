# Contributing to Kaazi Clips

Thanks for helping! Kaazi Clips is a local-first AI clipping app. Python
FastAPI backend + Electron/React UI. Issues labeled
[`good-first-issue`](../../labels/good-first-issue) are small and
well-scoped if you want a place to start.

## Fixing a bug from a Feedback Hub report

Most bug reports arrive through the app's in-app Feedback Hub (label
[`from-app`](../../labels/from-app)). They're written by non-technical
streamers, but each one carries an auto-collected **Diagnostics** block:

- exact app commit, Windows version, CPU/GPU/VRAM/RAM
- the AI model in use (name, parameter size, quantization, Ollama version)
- FFmpeg / OpenCV / faster-whisper / yt-dlp versions
- the non-secret settings, the video's platform, and the recent log tail

That block is the reproduction recipe: match the model + settings and feed
a similar video (platform matters. Twitch/Kick VODs are H.264; YouTube
sources are H.264 by design, see `video/encoding.py`). Secrets and
usernames are redacted before reports ever leave the reporter's machine.

## Dev setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install ruff pytest          # the checks CI runs
cd ui && npm install
npm run dev                      # starts Electron + the backend together
```

Working on the interface only? `npm run dev:web` serves it in a browser
instead, with no Electron and no rebuild loop. The Electron-only calls
(file pickers, the donate window) are stubbed there. See
`ui/src/renderer/src/lib/browserShim.ts`.

Before a PR:

```
pytest                                   # deterministic logic
ruff check .                             # lint
cd ui && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

Want to add a language, a model, a platform or an export format? Each is a
small, well-defined change. See [docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md).

### Or use Docker: nothing else to install

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and
that is the whole list. Compose ships inside it; there is no second install.

```
docker compose pull             # prebuilt engine image, skips a 10-min build
docker compose up               # engine :8765, interface :5173, Ollama
docker compose run --rm engine pytest
```

Saves installing Python, FFmpeg, PyTorch, OpenCV and Node locally, and lets
you contribute from Linux or macOS to an app that only ships for Windows.
Electron itself still runs on your host, since it needs a display. See
[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md).

## Something to run against

You do not need a stream to start. There is a written-out transcript and a
generator for synthetic footage in [tests/assets/](tests/assets/):

```
python tests/assets/make_sample_video.py     # 2 min, 1080p, known audio peaks
```

And [examples/](examples/) has small runnable programs for the two things
you are most likely to be doing:

```
python examples/score_a_transcript.py --fake   # clip selection, seconds per run
python examples/drive_the_api.py               # the pipeline over HTTP
```

`--fake` uses a canned model reply, so scoring logic can be worked on with
no Ollama and no waiting, and behaves the same way every run. If you are
changing how clips get picked, that loop is worth learning first. The
alternative is a full transcribe-and-render per attempt.

## Building on the app rather than in it

You do not have to change Kaazi Clips to use it. The desktop window is one
client of a local HTTP API, and anything else can be another. A bot, a batch
runner, a different interface entirely.

- **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)**: the endpoints meant to be built on, the
  supported-versus-internal line, and the traps worth knowing first
- **[docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md)**: changing the app itself, by adding
  a language, a platform, an AI model or an export format

If you build something, say so in an issue. Needing an endpoint is the fastest
way to get it moved from internal to supported.

## Building the Windows installer

```
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
python scripts/build_installer.py
```

That runs the whole chain and stops at the first failure with an
explanation: fetch FFmpeg → freeze the Python engine with PyInstaller →
smoke-test the frozen engine → build the renderer → wrap it all up. The
results land in `release/`: a small **Web Setup .exe**, the **.7z payload**
it downloads, and a **.zip** for offline installs.

Publish the Web Setup and the .7z to the *same* GitHub release. The setup
fetches the payload by name, so one without the other is useless. Full
release checklist: [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

Expect it to take a while and to need disk: the frozen engine is ~4.8 GB
unpacked, mostly CUDA PyTorch. `--skip-backend` and `--skip-ui` reuse the
previous run's output while iterating, and `--backend-only` stops after the
freeze.

Things worth knowing before you change any of it:

- **The backend is frozen as a console app on purpose.** A windowed
  PyInstaller build gives the process no stdout, and every `print()` in the
  pipeline then raises. Electron passes `windowsHide` so no console appears.
- **PyTorch ships as the CUDA build.** It isn't only for tracking: those
  wheels carry the cuBLAS/cuDNN DLLs that CTranslate2 needs for GPU
  transcription, so a CPU build silently drops Whisper to CPU as well.
- **FFmpeg comes from `vendor/`,** fetched by `scripts/fetch_ffmpeg.py` and
  gitignored. Never call `ffmpeg` by bare name. Use `core.binaries.ffmpeg()`,
  or an installed copy will look for a binary the user doesn't have.
- **Code signing is off** (`signAndEditExecutable: false`). electron-builder
  otherwise downloads a bundle containing macOS symlinks, which an ordinary
  Windows account cannot extract. The trade-off and how to re-enable it are
  documented in `ui/electron-builder.yml`.
- **Don't switch the target back to plain `nsis`.** `makensis.exe` is 32-bit
  and memory-maps the payload to embed it, so it dies around 2 GB with
  `failed creating mmap`. The app is ~5 GB unpacked. That is a ceiling, not
  a setting.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused on one issue; link it ("Fixes #123").
- `npm run typecheck` clean; try the affected flow in the running app.
- Match the style around you: comments explain *why*, not *what*.

CI runs on every PR: Python compiles, config and prompts parse, the desktop
app typechecks and builds, and website links resolve. It is fast and it is
narrow. A runner has no GPU, no Ollama and no footage, so **a green tick does
not mean clips still come out well.** Anything touching scoring, tracking,
captions or rendering needs testing against a real video, and the PR should
say which one.

## Triage (maintainers)

Priority = 👍 reactions + comment count on issues, `critical` /
`high-priority` labels first. Duplicates: close with a link to the
canonical issue so reactions concentrate in one place.

## Licence

Kaazi Clips is **AGPL-3.0**, and contributions are accepted under the same
terms: opening a PR means you are licensing your change that way.

Practically: your work stays available to the creators this was built for,
and nobody can take the project closed.

Adding a dependency? Check its licence first. Anything the installer bundles
has to be compatible with AGPL-3.0, and a new one belongs in the third-party
list in [NOTICE](NOTICE).
