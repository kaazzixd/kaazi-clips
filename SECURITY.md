# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Kaazi Clips has not had a stable release yet. Security fixes land on `main`, and the
latest commit is the only supported version. Once releases begin, this table will list
the supported ones.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Report it privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](../../security/advisories/new). That opens a
discussion visible only to you and the maintainers.

Please include:

- what the vulnerability lets an attacker do
- the steps to reproduce it
- the affected file or component, if you know it
- your OS, Python version, and app commit

You can expect an acknowledgement within a week. If a fix is needed, we'll agree a
disclosure timeline with you and credit you in the advisory unless you'd rather stay
anonymous.

## What is in scope

Kaazi Clips is a **local desktop application**. The interesting attack surface is
mostly about untrusted input and local exposure:

- **The local API** (`server/`) binds to `127.0.0.1:8765`. Anything that lets a remote
  or cross-origin page reach it, or that widens that binding, is in scope.
- **Path handling**: export folders, media serving, and file imports. Path traversal
  out of the data directory is in scope.
- **Untrusted video and transcript content** reaching a shell, an FFmpeg argument, or a
  file path. Command injection through a video title or filename is in scope.
- **Prompt content reaching disk or the shell.** The LLM's output is treated as
  untrusted and validated before it is applied; a way around that validation is in
  scope.
- **Credential handling**: YouTube OAuth tokens and `config/client_secret.json`.
- **The feedback relay** (`feedback-relay/`) and the diagnostics attached to in-app
  reports. Diagnostics are redacted before leaving the reporter's machine; a leak of
  secrets or personal data through that path is in scope and important.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** that are actually reachable from Kaazi Clips code.

## What is out of scope

- Attacks needing an attacker who already has local code execution or admin rights on
  the machine. A local desktop app can't defend against that.
- Vulnerabilities in Ollama, FFmpeg, yt-dlp, or the AI models themselves: report those
  upstream. If Kaazi Clips *uses* one of them unsafely, that part is in scope.
- The quality, bias, or content of AI-generated clips, titles, or translations. Those
  are bugs or feature requests, not security issues.
- Denial of service by feeding the app a deliberately enormous video.
- Anything requiring a user to change a default setting to something clearly unsafe.

## Known dependency advisories

`npm audit` currently reports findings, most of which are in the tooling that
*builds* the installer rather than in anything shipped to a user.
[docs/DEPENDENCY-SECURITY.md](docs/DEPENDENCY-SECURITY.md) goes through them
one at a time: what ships, what does not, what is reachable from app code, and
what is already mitigated. Please read it before reporting one, and do report
anything it does not cover.

## A note on what this app does

Kaazi Clips downloads videos with yt-dlp and processes them locally. It never uploads
your footage anywhere unless you ask it to. The only outbound network traffic in a
normal run is fetching the source video, an optional Twitch chat-replay request, model
downloads you ask for, and (only if you submit one) an in-app feedback report.

The exception is publishing. If you switch on **Settings → Publish to YouTube**, connect
your own Google account and press Upload, the clip goes from your machine straight to
YouTube. That is the whole point of the feature, and it never happens on its own: it is
off by default, it needs your own Google Cloud API key, and every upload is one you
pressed a button for. Nothing is proxied through a Kaazi Clips server, because there
isn't one.

Two things worth knowing if you turn it on:

- **The local API has no authentication** (see above). While an account is connected,
  anything that can reach `127.0.0.1:8765` can publish to your channel. That is the same
  trust boundary as the rest of the API (it can already read your footage) but the
  consequence is more visible here.
- **Your credentials stay on your machine.** The OAuth token and your Google client
  secret are stored with Windows DPAPI, encrypted against your Windows account, so
  copying the data folder to another PC or user does not carry them over. On Linux and
  in the Docker image there is no DPAPI, and they fall back to an owner-only (0600)
  file, which protects against other users on the box, not against someone who already
  has your account.
