"""Multimodal fusion: combines transcript, audio, visual, and reaction
signals into one 0-100 clip score.

    final = w_text*text + w_visual*visual + w_reaction*reaction
          + w_audio*audio + w_engagement*engagement      (weights in config)

Candidates come from two pools:
  1. transcript pool — Gemma's picks (analysis/highlights.py), now informed
     by an EVENTS timeline built from the signals
  2. signal pool — windows where combined audio+visual excitement exceeds
     the configured percentile; their transcript text is scored by Gemma in
     one extra call so they compete on equal footing

After dedup, the top finalists go through a RERANK pass: Gemma orders them
against each other (relative judgment — far more reliable for small local
models than absolute 0-100 scoring, which clusters).
