"""What the game writes on screen, for the gaming profile.

Games announce their moments in big letters: ELIMINATED, VICTORY ROYALE,
PENTA KILL, "X SCORED", YOU DIED, ENEMY FELLED. They also fill the screen
with text when nothing is happening: a settings page, a queue, a loading
screen, which chat will happily react to. Reading the screen tells the two
apart where the transcript, chat and the game's sound can't.

OCR (RapidOCR: PaddleOCR's models on onnxruntime, Apache-2.0) costs about a
second a frame on a CPU, so it only reads the game-moment windows, a frame
every few seconds, strongest first, within a time budget. It reads Latin
script and kanji (not kana), and config/gaming.yaml's screen_text lists
each word in the languages games are commonly played in.

  - A banner (big text near the middle) with an event word becomes an
    "ON SCREEN:" event for the model and the clip's breakdown. It adds no
    points of its own: most videos never show one.
  - A window where most frames show menu words (a few different ones across
    it) is marked as a menu, and scores a little lower.
