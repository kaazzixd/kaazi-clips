"""The AI looks at the best candidates of a gaming stream.

Everything else the gaming profile scores with is a stand-in for the
picture: chat, the game's sound, a banner's words, the transcript. The last
check before ranking shows the local model a few frames of each of the best
candidates and asks what happens in them: a fight, a goal, a boss going down,
or a menu, a loading screen, nothing at all.

Only a local model that takes images does it (Gemma 3 and Gemma 4 through
Ollama; gemma:7b can't). The video picture never leaves the PC, as the
privacy page promises, so a cloud AI skips this step. Its verdict moves a
clip by at most 10 points either way, within a time budget. It only takes
points off as far as the clip is quiet: what is said counts as on any stream,
so a just-chatting stretch or a reaction with no gameplay in the picture
isn't marked down for that.
