"""Propose cuts that tighten a clip: dead air and filler words.

Retention on short-form is decided in the first seconds, and a clip that
opens with two seconds of "uhh..." has spent them. This finds the pauses
and the filler words and returns the ranges worth dropping.

It PROPOSES only. The ranges go into the editor's normal edit list, drawn
on the timeline like any hand-made cut, so they can be reviewed, adjusted
or undone before anything is rendered — cutting someone's video silently
on a guess is not a trade worth making.

Silence comes from FFmpeg's silencedetect rather than from gaps in the
transcript: a gap between words is not necessarily quiet, and cutting
music, laughter or a held reaction would be worse than leaving the pause.
