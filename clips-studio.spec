# PyInstaller spec — freezes the Python engine into resources/backend/api.exe
#
# Build with:  python scripts/build_installer.py     (don't call this directly)
#
# One-DIR, not one-file. One-file unpacks the whole payload to a temp folder
# on every launch, and with PyTorch in the bundle that is gigabytes of copying
# before the app answers its first request — slow and fragile. One-dir starts
# instantly and lets the installer share files properly.
#
# Console app on purpose: the backend prints its progress, and Electron reads
# or discards that. A windowed build sets sys.stdout to None, which turns
# every print() in the pipeline into a crash. Electron passes windowsHide so
# no console window is ever shown to the user.
