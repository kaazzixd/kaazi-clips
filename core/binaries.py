"""Where the bundled binaries and model weights live.

The pipeline shells out to FFmpeg constantly. A developer running from the
repo has it on PATH, so the code used to just say "ffmpeg" and hope — which
is fine until someone installs the app. Creators do not have FFmpeg, and
"download FFmpeg, unzip it, add it to your PATH, restart" is exactly the
friction that makes them close the installer and never come back.

So an installed copy ships its own and this module finds them. Resolution
order, first hit wins:

  1. CLIPS_STUDIO_FFMPEG / CLIPS_STUDIO_FFPROBE / CLIPS_STUDIO_OLLAMA —
     explicit override, for debugging or pinning a custom build.
  2. Next to the frozen executable — where the installer puts them.
  3. PATH — the developer case, and any system-wide install.

Falling back to the bare name (rather than raising) keeps the repo workflow
working even if nothing is bundled: the OS resolves it, and if it genuinely
isn't there the caller gets FileNotFoundError naming the binary, which is a
clearer error than anything invented here.

The same reasoning covers the Ollama runtime and the Whisper weights. Those
are not binaries on a PATH, but they fail the same way — as an errand handed
to someone who only wanted to clip a video — so they resolve through here too.

    Electron spawns the engine without setting a working directory, so the
