"""Cooperative cancellation for in-flight video processing.

The worker runs one video at a time in a thread. Killing a thread mid-FFmpeg
is unsafe, so cancellation is cooperative: the API marks a video_id cancelled,
and the pipeline checks at every stage boundary (and inside the download
progress hook and render loop), raising CancelledError to unwind cleanly.

    segments. Cancel therefore did nothing until the whole stage finished,
    which on a long video with a big model is hours. The UI said
    "cancelling" and meant it; there was simply nobody listening.

    The worker runs one video at a time and already records which one, so
    deep code can ask "should I stop?" without a video id being threaded
    through every signature it sits behind.

    Cheap enough for a per-iteration call: one lock and a set lookup.
