"""Find and remove files the app no longer needs.

Processing the same video repeatedly leaves things behind: a render that
failed or was cancelled kept its multi-hundred-MB staging file, yt-dlp
leaves `.part` fragments when a download is interrupted, and every editor
preview writes a full clip that is never read again. None of it is
referenced by the database, so it is invisible — the disk just shrinks.

Nothing here touches a file the database still points at. Source downloads
for videos you still have are NOT scratch and are reported separately: the
editor, re-rendering and translated burns all read them, so removing one
costs you those features until the video is downloaded again.
