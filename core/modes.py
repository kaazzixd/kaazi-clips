"""Vertical Live: a livestream already composed as 9:16 during the broadcast.

A YouTube vertical live, the vertical feed of a Twitch Dual Format or
Streamlabs Dual Output stream, or a downloaded Instagram/TikTok/YouTube live
MP4. The streamer already placed the gameplay, webcam and chat on a 9:16
canvas, so there is nothing to reframe: Vertical Live keeps that composition
and skips everything that decides where to point the frame (face tracking,
TalkNet, the layout decisions), while everything that decides WHICH moments
matter runs exactly as it does for any other video.

It is the user's explicit choice, a toggle of its own: a video being tall is
not enough (a vertical upload may still want the standard treatment), so
nothing here switches it on by itself. This module is the one place that says
what it means; web/lib/vertical.ts mirrors the numbers (a test keeps the two
in step).
