    `bundled` is the copy that ships with the app. In a checkout that is the
    file in the repo and there is nothing to decide: editing it is the point,
    and it is already under version control.

    An installed build is different. The bundled copy sits inside the
    installation directory, and the app writes to it — switching the model
    rewrites the `model:` line, and saving settings rewrites the file. That
    only works because the NSIS installer happens to install per-user, into a
    directory that happens to be writable. A per-machine install puts it under
    Program Files, and an MSIX package makes it read-only outright; in both
    cases changing the model fails, which looks like the setting not sticking
    rather than a permissions error.

    So an installed build keeps its settings beside its data, in the same
    per-user location resolve_data_dir() already chose for downloads and the
    database. The bundled file becomes what it is packaged as: read-only
    defaults.

    Seeding is what makes this safe to ship into existing installs. On first
    use the bundled copy — which for an already-installed creator is the one
    they have been editing — is copied out rather than ignored, so an upgrade
    carries their settings across instead of silently resetting them.

    The complement to safe_name(). Importing any video from anywhere on your
    own disk is the whole point of the local-file feature, so there is no
    directory to confine these to and no allowlist of names to check against.
    What can be checked is that the request describes an ordinary local file
    of a kind this app can actually open:

    * resolved, so `..` segments are collapsed before anything acts on it
    * a real regular file, not a directory, device or dangling symlink
    * a local path, not a `\\\\server\\share` UNC one — the desktop app's file
      dialog never produces those, and honouring them would let anything that
      can reach the API pull files off the network shares this machine can see
    * one of `allowed_suffixes`, so the endpoint that wants an image cannot be
      talked into probing something else

    Returns everything a caller needs so that none of them has to touch the
    filesystem again with a user-derived value: the resolved path, the
    **suffix constant that matched** — taken from `allowed_suffixes`, not from
    the name on disk, so a filename built from it can only ever end in one of
    the extensions this endpoint accepts — and the stat already taken here.
    An earlier version returned only the path, and every caller went on to
    call .stat(), .resolve() and .suffix for itself; that is how one validated
    path turned into seven separate places handling untrusted input.

    The single os.stat also closes the gap between "does it exist" and "is it
    a regular file", which two calls left open.

    None of this makes an arbitrary path safe in the abstract; it makes these
    endpoints do only the narrow thing they advertise. The rest of the
    guarantee is that the API binds 127.0.0.1 and the path is chosen by a
