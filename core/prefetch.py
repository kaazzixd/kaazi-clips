"""Download prefetcher: overlap the NEXT queued video's download with the
CURRENT video's processing.

Downloading is pure network I/O while transcription/analysis/rendering are
CPU/GPU work, so they overlap perfectly — by the time the worker reaches the
next job, its source file is (usually) already on disk and the download stage
is skipped. One slot only: at most one video is prefetched ahead, so disk and
bandwidth use stay bounded.

Safety model: prefetching is BEST-EFFORT. Any failure here is logged and
ignored — the job itself will re-attempt the download and surface errors
through the normal path. The worker calls wait_for() before processing a
video so a job never races its own half-written prefetch download.

        The limit is the point. This used to be a bare join() with no timeout,
        which is only safe if a download can be trusted to finish or fail, and
        it cannot: a stalled fragment fetch just sits there. When that
        happened the SINGLE worker thread blocked here forever, so every job
        queued afterwards stayed 'queued' and the app silently stopped
        processing anything. Five jobs had piled up behind one dead download,
        with nothing in the UI to say why.

        Prefetching is best-effort by design (see the module docstring), so a
        prefetch that has gone quiet for this long is abandoned rather than
        waited on. The job then does its own download, which is the path that
        reports errors properly. A slow-but-alive prefetch still finishes well
