"""Is this install actually able to make a clip?

An installed copy has more ways to be half-ready than a dev checkout: FFmpeg
might not have shipped, the AI runtime might not have started, the model might
not be pulled, the transcription weights might be absent, the disk might be
full. Each of those used to surface as a stack trace somewhere deep in a
pipeline stage, twenty minutes into a video.

This checks them up front and says which one is wrong in words a creator can
act on. The setup wizard runs it on first launch; the app can run it any time
something looks broken.

Nothing here raises — a check that itself fails is reported as a failed check.
