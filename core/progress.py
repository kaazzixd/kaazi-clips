"""Process-wide progress event hook.

The pipeline emits structured events at stage boundaries; by default nothing
listens (CLI runs just print as before). The API server installs a handler
that broadcasts events to UI clients over WebSocket.

Deliberately tiny: no queues, no threads — just a settable callback that can
never break the pipeline.
