"""Queue manager: the orchestration layer around the existing pipeline.

Kaazi Clips already ran jobs one at a time — a `jobs` row, a single worker
thread, and crash recovery (see server/jobs.py). What was missing is the part
a person needs to leave a batch running overnight: ordering, pausing, retrying,
and knowing how long it will take. That is what lives here.

Layering, deliberately one direction:

    Queue Manager (this module)
        -> Queue Item              a `jobs` row
        -> Processing Config       jobs.payload, a JSON snapshot
        -> Video Pipeline          core.pipeline.process_video
        -> Result / Error          job status + error + data/logs/job_N.log

This module knows about a StateDB and nothing else — no FastAPI, no UI. The
API layer translates HTTP to these calls, and the worker asks it whether it
may claim work. That keeps the queue testable and stops queue rules from
leaking into either end.

Invariants worth keeping:
  * One video at a time. The GPU is the bottleneck; two videos at once make
    both slower (ARCHITECTURE.md section 10).
  * A payload is a SNAPSHOT. Once a job runs, editing another job's settings
    cannot reach it.
  * Stopping never deletes. Pause survives a restart; the queue is still there.
  * A failure is contained to its own video; the queue carries on to the next.
