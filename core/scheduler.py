"""Daemon loop: RSS monitoring + processing queue + daily upload schedule.

Cycle (every poll_interval_minutes):
  1. Poll each configured channel's RSS feed; insert unseen videos as 'queued'.
  2. Process queued/interrupted videos through the pipeline (oldest first).
  3. Promote rendered clips into today's schedule, highest score first,
     never exceeding upload.daily_limit per calendar day. Clips over the
     limit stay 'queued' in SQLite — they survive restarts and drain on
     following days.

The 'scheduled' status means "selected for upload today". The future
YouTube upload module consumes scheduled clips and marks them 'uploaded';
until it exists, scheduled clips simply wait.
