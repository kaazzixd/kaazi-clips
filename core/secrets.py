"""Somewhere to keep OAuth tokens that isn't a plaintext file.

Until now the YouTube refresh token sat in `<data_dir>/youtube_token.json` as
readable JSON. A refresh token is a long-lived key to someone's channel, so
that is worth improving before the app starts asking every user for one.

Windows gets DPAPI (`CryptProtectData`), reached through ctypes. That was
chosen over the `keyring` package deliberately:

* it needs no new dependency, no PyInstaller hidden import, and no extra
  failure mode in the frozen build;
* the blob is tied to the Windows *user account*, so copying `data/` to another
  machine or another user cannot decrypt it;
* `keyring` on Linux wants a Secret Service that the project's Docker image
  does not have, so it would degrade to a plaintext backend anyway — i.e. we
  would pay a dependency to arrive back at the fallback below.

Everywhere else there is a 0600 file, and this module is honest about that
being obfuscation-free: it protects against another user on the box, not
against someone who already has your account.

Nothing here ever logs a value.
