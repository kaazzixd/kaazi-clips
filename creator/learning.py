"""Preference learning: what does this creator's user actually keep?

Positive signals from clip_feedback (exports are the strongest "this one was
worth posting"; caption/timestamp edits mean the user invested in the clip).
We compare the subscore profile of those clips against the creator's library
average: channels that run consistently hotter in kept clips get a bounded
up-weight in fusion.

Guardrails (this must never destabilize scoring):
  * inert below MIN_SIGNALS positive events — no data, no opinion;
  * each weight can shift at most MAX_SHIFT (20%) from its configured value;
  * weights are renormalized, so the total influence budget never changes;
  * derived from the user's OWN actions only — never from the LLM.
