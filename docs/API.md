# The local API

Clips Kitty is a desktop app on top of a **local HTTP service**. The desktop
window is one client of it. Anything else can be another: a Discord bot that
clips a stream on command, a batch runner, a web front end, an OBS integration,
a script that queues last night's VOD every morning.

Nothing needs to be added to the app for that to work. The service is already
running whenever Clips Kitty is open, on `127.0.0.1:8765`.

The service has 86 HTTP endpoints and a WebSocket. This document covers the
subset meant to be built against. Most of the rest are the desktop UI talking
to itself, and are listed as internal below.

> **Every example here was run against a live instance**, and the responses are
> real (with the video titles swapped for made-up ones). If something in this
> file does not work, that is a bug worth reporting.

## Start it

If the desktop app is open, the API is already up. It is the same process
tree, and the app is just a window onto it.

Headless, which is usually what an integrator wants:

```bash
python main.py serve --port 8765
```

Confirm it is alive:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
# {"ok":true}
```

**FastAPI's interactive docs are served too**, and they are generated from the
running code rather than written by hand, so they never drift:

| | |
|---|---|
| `http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs` | Swagger UI. Every endpoint, try them in the browser |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8765/redoc` | the same thing, easier to read |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8765/openapi.json` | the schema, for generating a client |

Use those for the full list. Use this document for which ones to build on and
what actually happens when you call them.

## Security: read this before binding anything

**There is no authentication. None.** Not a token, not a password, not an
origin check.

That is a deliberate trade for a single-user desktop app on loopback, and it
means anything that can reach the port can:

- read every video title, transcript and clip on the machine
- stream the video files themselves out of `/media/{clip_id}`
- queue downloads, delete clips, delete videos, change settings

`main.py` binds `127.0.0.1` by default and prints a warning if you change it:

```
WARNING: binding 0.0.0.0 — this API has no authentication.
```

**Requests must be addressed to `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.**
- **Other hosts are refused.** A request whose `Host` header names anything else
  gets a 400. That stops a web page from reaching the API through DNS rebinding,
  where its own domain is pointed at this computer.
- **This is not authentication.** Any program running on this computer can still
  call the API.

**Exposing this to a network is not a supported configuration.** If you need
remote access, put your own authenticated service in front of it and keep the
API itself on loopback. `--host 0.0.0.0` exists for containers, where
"localhost" means the container and nothing on the host can reach in anyway.

## Which data directory you are talking to

Easy to lose an hour to, so it is near the top:

| How it is running | Where its database and videos live |
|---|---|
| Installed build | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Clips Studio\data` |
| A source checkout | `<repo>/data` |

These are **separate libraries with separate databases**. A checkout resolves
the relative `paths.data_dir` against the repo, not the working directory, so a
dev instance and an installed instance disagree about which videos exist even
though they serve identical routes on the same machine, and will happily fight
over the same port.

Two consequences worth knowing before you debug something confusing:

- A video that is `done` in the installed app is unknown to a source run, so
  the "already processed" guard does not fire and it downloads again.
- If you run a second instance for development, give it `--port 8766`. It still
  runs its own worker thread and will claim jobs from *its* queue.

## Supported and internal

The endpoints in this document are the ones intended to be built on. They will
not change shape without a note in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

**Everything else is internal**: branding assets, creator memory, caption
editing, the AI edit endpoints, feedback submission. They exist to serve one
specific screen and they change when that screen changes. They are visible in
`/docs`, they work, and depending on them is at your own risk.

That line is drawn now because it cannot be drawn retroactively. If something
internal is genuinely useful to you, open an issue asking for it to be
promoted, rather than pinning yourself to a version.

This is alpha software. The line above is a commitment to *tell you*, not a
guarantee of never changing.

## Conventions

- **JSON in, JSON out.** `Content-Type: application/json` on anything with a body.
- **Job IDs are integers.** `149`. Passing a non-integer gets a 422, not a 404.
- **Video IDs are strings with a platform prefix.** YouTube uses its own
  11-character ID (`aB3dEfGhIjK`), Twitch prefixes `tw_`, Kick prefixes `kick_`,
  an imported file gets `local_`. They cannot collide, which is the point.
- **Clip IDs are integers**, unique across all videos.
- **Errors** are `{"detail": "..."}` with 400 (bad request), 404 (no such
  thing), or 409 (queue full). Validation failures are FastAPI's standard 422
  with a list of field errors.
- **No pagination anywhere.** `GET /videos` returns every video, `GET /jobs`
  every job. Fine for a personal library; know it before you point this at
  10,000 rows.
- **Times are seconds as floats.** Timestamps are naive local ISO-8601
  (`2026-08-15T13:56:15`), not UTC, with no timezone marker.

## Readiness

### `GET /health`

```json
{"ok": true, "app_version": "1.1.4", "api_version": 1}
```

The liveness check. Cheap enough to poll.

- **`api_version`** changes only when a supported endpoint changes shape. A tool
  can check it once and tell its user to update Clips Kitty, instead of failing
  in some stranger way later.
- **`app_version`** is the installed release.

### `GET /health/preflight`

Whether it can actually *do* anything, which is a different question.

```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "checks": [
    {"name": "ffmpeg",  "ok": true, "detail": "8.1.2-essentials_build", "fix": "", "blocking": true},
    {"name": "ollama",  "ok": true, "detail": "running, 2 model(s) installed", "fix": "", "blocking": true},
    {"name": "model",   "ok": true, "detail": "gemma:7b installed", "fix": "", "blocking": true},
    {"name": "whisper", "ok": true, "detail": "large-v3-turbo, small bundled", "fix": "", "blocking": false},
    {"name": "gpu",     "ok": true, "detail": "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (13 GB)", "fix": "", "blocking": false},
    {"name": "disk",    "ok": true, "detail": "67 GB free", "fix": "", "blocking": false}
  ]
}
```

Seven checks: `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `ollama`, `model`, `whisper`, `gpu`, `disk`.
**Call this before submitting work.** A failing `blocking` check means the job
will be accepted and then die: no model installed is the common one. `fix`
carries a human-readable remedy when a check fails.

`gpu` and `disk` are non-blocking: it runs on the CPU, slowly.

### `GET /system/stats`

```json
{
  "cpu_percent": 4.2, "ram_percent": 61.0,
  "data_dir_bytes": 48216342528, "disk_free_bytes": 72341598208,
  "gpu": {"name": "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060", "vram_used": 1024, "vram_total": 12288, "gpu_percent": 3},
  "build_sha": "", "started_at": 1755261234.5, "uptime_seconds": 8134.2
}
```

`gpu` is `null` on a machine without one.

## Submitting work

### `POST /jobs`

The main entry point. Only `url` is required.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3dEfGhIjK"}'
```

```json
{"job_id": 149}
```

Takes YouTube, Twitch and Kick links. Optional fields, all defaulting to the
values in `config/settings.yaml`:

| Field | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `force` | bool | process again even if this video is already done |
| `max_clips` | int | cap clips from this video |
| `min_score` | int | quality bar, 0–100 |
| `captions` | bool | burn captions in (default true) |
| `caption_style` | object | font, size, colour, position, `words_per_caption`; `second_speaker` (bool) with `second_speaker_color` burns anyone but the main speaker in another colour |
| `long_clips` | bool | 61–180s clips, for TikTok monetisation |
| `podcast` | bool | multi-camera: letterbox, no subject tracking |
| `longform` | object | `{"mode": ...}`: `short_clips`, `clips_140`, `highlights` or `edited_stream`; add `"shorts": true` to make the 9:16 Shorts in the same job |
| `focus` | string | what the clips should be about, in plain words (up to 600 characters): a topic, a moment, a time range ("1:35-1:55", "near the end") or a style (funny, laughing, hype, reactions). It only adds points to what matches and never removes a clip; a must-have that was never said is reported in the video's `outcome.intent`, never invented |
| `sport` | object | a match: `{"name": "soccer", "highlights": "goals", "period": "full", "teams": "Team A"}`. `highlights` is `best`, `goals`, `goals_celebrations`, `saves`, `chances`, `attacking`, `cards`, `penalties` or `custom` (with `request`, the moments in words); `period` is `full`, `first_half`, `second_half` or `extra_time`; `footage` is `auto` (the default), `broadcast` or `sideline` (club or phone footage); `events` is the match's events as text, one per line ("18:16 Goal", "45+2' yellow card"); `reels` is any of `recap`, `teams` and `players`, the story reels to join from the clips; `teams` is optional. `GET /sports` lists them. Not with `gaming` or `podcast`. See [SPORTS.md](SPORTS.md) |
| `filter` | string | colour preset from `video/filters.py` |
| `watermark_profile_id` | int | branding profile applied to every clip |
| `webhook_url` | string | http(s) URL to POST once when this job finishes |
| `webhook_secret` | string | signs that POST, so the listener can trust it |

**Two responses that are not failures and not `job_id`:**

```json
{"job_id": null, "already_processed": true, "video_id": "tw_2833826919"}
{"job_id": null, "already_queued": true, "video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK", "queued_job_id": 148}
```

Re-submitting a finished video is silently a no-op without `force`, because
processing costs an hour and produces duplicate clips. **Check for `job_id`
being `null`** rather than assuming a job was created. Retry with
`{"force": true}` if you meant it.

Other outcomes:

- `409`: the queue is full (the cap is a real limit, not a greyed-out button)
- `422`: no `url` field

> Two known warts, both harmless: this returns **200**, not 201, and it accepts
> a stray `status_code` query parameter that does nothing. Do not send it.

### Webhooks: being told instead of asking

Pass `webhook_url` and the engine POSTs once, when the job reaches a terminal
state. That is the whole feature: no polling loop in your dock, your cron job or
your n8n flow for the forty minutes a stream takes.

```json
{"event": "job.done", "job_id": 149, "job_type": "process", "status": "done",
 "video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK", "title": "Friday stream", "clips": 38, "error": ""}
```

`event` is `job.done`, `job.failed` or `job.cancelled`, so a listener can switch
on one field. Every key is always present, including on a job that failed before
its video was identified.

Add `webhook_secret` and the body is signed:

```
X-Clips-Kitty-Signature: sha256=<hmac-sha256 of the exact body bytes>
```

Verify against the **raw bytes you received**, not a re-serialised copy of them:
key order and spacing would differ and every signature would fail.

Three deliberate limits:

- **One attempt.** A retry queue turns a listener that was down into a burst of
  duplicate deliveries later, and `GET /jobs/{id}` is always there.
- **A 10 second timeout.** Delivery runs on the worker thread between two jobs,
  so a listener that accepts the connection and then hangs would stall the queue.
- **A failed delivery never fails the job.** It is a line in the job log.

`webhook_url` must be `http` or `https`; anything else is rejected at submission
with a `400`, rather than discovered forty minutes later.

### `POST /jobs/batch`

Several links at once, each with its own settings.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/jobs/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items": [{"url": "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/123456789"}, {"url": "not a link"}]}'
```

```json
{
  "created": [{"url": "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/123456789", "job_id": 150, "video_id": "tw_123456789"}],
  "skipped": [{"url": "not a link", "reason": "unrecognized"}]
}
```

**Deliberately tolerant**: one bad link in a list of twelve reports itself and
the other eleven still queue. `reason` is one of `unrecognized`,
`already_processed`, `already_queued`, `queue_full`, `bad_option`. Always read
`skipped`. The request succeeds with a 200 even when nothing was queued.

### `POST /videos/local`

A file already on this computer. No download, same pipeline.

```json
{"path": "D:/streams/friday.mp4", "title": "Friday stream", "channel": "examplechannel"}
```

`title` defaults to the filename. **Set `channel`**: creator profiles key off
it, so an empty one means catchphrase learning and preference history quietly
do not run for that video. Accepts the same option fields as `POST /jobs`.

A path that is not a readable video gives `400`:

```json
{"detail": "not a video file this app can open: C:/does/not/exist.mp4"}
```

### `GET /sports`

The sports a job's `sport` option can name, with the choices each takes:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "soccer", "label": "Soccer",
    "highlights": [{"id": "best", "label": "Best moments"}, {"id": "goals", "label": "All goals"}],
    "periods": [{"id": "full", "label": "Full match"}, {"id": "first_half", "label": "1st half"}]
  }
]
```

(Shortened: soccer has nine highlight choices and four periods.) A `sport`
naming anything else is refused with a `400` that lists what is allowed.

## Watching progress

### `GET /jobs`

Every job, newest last. Note this is a **bare array**, not an object:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 149, "type": "process", "status": "done", "error": "",
    "video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK", "title": "Friday stream",
    "position": 3, "attempts": 0, "interrupted": 0,
    "created_at": "2026-08-15T13:56:15", "started_at": "2026-08-15T13:56:15",
    "updated_at": "2026-08-15T14:41:02", "finished_at": "2026-08-15T14:41:02",
    "payload": "{\"url\": \"...\", \"force\": false}"
  }
]
```

`status` is `queued`, `running`, `done` or `failed`.

### `GET /jobs/{id}`

One job, same shape. `404 {"detail": "no such job"}` if it is gone.

### `GET /jobs/{id}/log`

```json
{"log": "…", "missing": false}
```

The run's own log file, last 300 lines. `?tail=2000` for more. `missing` is
true when the file has been cleaned up. The in-memory event stream only holds
minutes, which is no use for a batch that failed at 3am. **This is the endpoint
to surface when a job fails**; `error` on the job row is one line, and the log
is why.

### `POST /jobs/{id}/retry`

Re-queue a failed job with its original settings.

### `DELETE /jobs/{id}`

```json
{"deleted": 149}
```

Removes a queued job. Also works on a running one. See `POST /cancel` first.

### `POST /cancel`

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/cancel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK"}'
```

```json
{"cancelling": "aB3dEfGhIjK"}
```

**Cooperative, not immediate.** The pipeline stops at its next stage boundary
(or aborts the download). A job cancelled during transcription keeps running
until transcription finishes. Accepts `video_id` or `url`; `400` with neither.

A cancelled download can leave a `.part` file in `data/downloads/`. See
`POST /storage/cleanup`.

## The queue

### `GET /queue`

The grouped view the UI renders, and the one endpoint to poll if you only poll
one:

```json
{
  "processing": [], "queued": [], "completed": [], "failed": [],
  "paused": false,
  "estimate": {"queued_seconds": 0, "per_video_seconds": 2400, "samples": 6, "confident": true},
  "capacity": 5, "max_active": 5
}
```

`max_active` is the cap on videos waiting or running at once (**5**);
`capacity` is how many more you may add right now. When `capacity` hits zero,
`POST /jobs` returns `409` and `POST /jobs/batch` skips with
`"reason": "queue_full"`.

Job objects here are **richer than in `GET /jobs`**. They add `log_path`,
`display_title`, `channel`, `url`, `source_seconds`, `video_status` and the
`settings` snapshot.

`estimate.confident` is false below three samples, because a 3-hour stream and
a 20-minute upload do not cost the same and two data points cannot tell you
which you have. Do not show a countdown when it is false.

### `POST /queue/pause` · `POST /queue/resume`

```json
{"paused": true}
```

Stops claiming new work. Whatever is running keeps running. **The pause state
lives in the database**, so it survives a restart, and a paused queue that
nobody un-paused looks exactly like a broken app. Check `paused` before
reporting that nothing is happening.

## Results

### `GET /videos`

Every processed video, newest first. A bare array:

```json
[
  {
    "video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK", "title": "Friday stream",
    "channel_id": "", "channel_name": "examplechannel",
    "status": "done", "duration": 10842.0, "clip_count": 38,
    "creator_id": 4, "creator_name": "examplechannel",
    "process_seconds": 2831.4,
    "created_at": "2026-08-12T21:49:50", "updated_at": "2026-08-12T22:09:28"
  }
]
```

### `GET /videos/{video_id}/clips`

```json
[
  {
    "id": 80, "video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK",
    "start_s": 3574.12, "end_s": 3590.64, "score": 98,
    "title": "The one about the sandwich",
    "description": "A short summary written by the model.",
    "hashtags": ["#clip", "#stream", "#funny"],
    "hook": "the transcript line the clip was chosen for",
    "path": "C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Clips Studio\\data\\clips\\…\\clip_03574-03590.mp4",
    "status": "queued", "scheduled_for": null,
    "created_at": "2026-08-12T22:00:50",
    "scores": {"text": 88, "audio": 54, "visual": 72, "reaction": 66,
               "engagement": 85, "action": 10, "trending": true,
               "source": "transcript", "rerank_position": 2},
    "render_opts": {"caption_style": {"font": "Arial", "font_size": 84,
                    "words_per_caption": 3, "uppercase": true}, "podcast": true}
  }
]
```

`score` is the final 0–100 ranking; `scores` is the breakdown that produced it,
which is the interesting part if you are building your own selection on top.
A clip from a `sport` job also carries the moment it is: `sport_event`
(`goal`, `save`...), `sport_label`, `sport_minute` (from the match clock),
`sport_t` (seconds into the video), `sport_team`, `sport_player`, `sport_period`,
`sport_why` (the signals that marked it) and `sport_bonus`. A story reel (the
`reels` option) carries `sport_reel` (`recap`, `team` or `player`) and
`sport_parts` instead, and `reel` and `of` (its team or player) in its render
options; re-rendering one is refused. The video's `outcome.sport`
says what the match gave: the moments found by type, the replays grouped and
the score read.

> **An unknown video ID returns `200 []`, not 404.** A typo in a video ID is
> indistinguishable from a video with no clips. Check `GET /videos` first.

### `GET /media/{clip_id}`

The rendered MP4.

```
curl -r 0-63 http://127.0.0.1:8765/media/80
→ 206 Partial Content, video/mp4, Content-Range: bytes 0-63/8922466
```

Supports range requests, so it can be the `src` of a `<video>` element and seek
properly. `404` if the clip or its file is gone. **`HEAD` returns 405**. Use a
one-byte range request if you only want the size.

### `GET /clips/{clip_id}/captions`

```json
{"lines": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 0.98, "text": "the first caption line"}]}
```

Clip-relative seconds. `GET /clips/{clip_id}/words` is the same data at word
granularity as `{"words": [{"start", "end", "word"}]}`, and returns
`{"words": []}` when the transcript file has been cleaned up.

## Models

### `GET /models`

```json
{
  "active": "ollama/gemma:7b",
  "installed": [{"name": "gemma:7b", "size_gb": 5.01}],
  "recommended": {"model": "gemma3:12b", "reason": "Sized for 13 GB of VRAM — …"},
  "recommendations": [{"hardware": "8 GB VRAM", "model": "gemma:7b", "note": "…"}],
  "other_models": [{"purpose": "Translation / multilingual", "model": "qwen3:8b / qwen3:14b", "note": "…"}]
}
```

`recommended` is the single answer for *this* machine, measured from actual
VRAM. `recommendations` is the whole table.

### `POST /models/activate`

```json
{"tag": "gemma3:12b"}
```

`400 {"detail": "'x' is not pulled yet"}` if it is not installed. Anything
Ollama serves works. The app has no allow-list.

### `POST /models/pull`

Downloads a model. Returns immediately; **progress arrives on the WebSocket**
as `{"type": "model_pull", "tag": …, "status": "done"}` (or `"error"`). A 12 GB model
on a slow connection is not an HTTP request you want to hold open.

### Where the AI runs: `/ai`

Local (Ollama and Whisper on this machine) is the default. For a machine that
cannot run the models, a cloud provider can do the AI work, or the transcription,
on **the user's own API key**, billed by that provider. There is no Clips Kitty key
or proxy. See [AI-BACKENDS.md](AI-BACKENDS.md) for what each provider does.

`GET /ai`:

```json
{
  "active": {"provider": "ollama", "model": "gemma:7b", "local": true},
  "transcription": {"backend": "local", "model": ""},
  "providers": [
    {"id": "ollama", "label": "This PC — Ollama", "local": true, "has_key": false, "key_tail": "", "…": "…"},
    {"id": "openrouter", "label": "OpenRouter", "local": false, "stt": true,
     "stt_models": ["openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo", "…"],
     "preferred": {"text": "google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it", "stt": "openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo",
                   "text_family": "google/gemma"},
     "key_label": "OpenRouter API key", "key_url": "…", "pricing_url": "…", "privacy": "…",
     "has_key": true, "key_tail": "9f3a"}
  ]
}
```

No route ever returns a key; `key_tail` is its last four characters.

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `PUT /ai/providers/{id}/key` `{"api_key"}` | Checks the key with the provider, then keeps it. A key that fails is not saved; `400` says why in plain words. |
| `DELETE /ai/providers/{id}/key` | Deletes the stored key. |
| `GET /ai/providers/{id}/models` | Models that can do the job, from the provider, with the user's key: `{"models": [{"id", "name", "context", "json_schema", "tools", "note"}]}`. Cached for a day; `?refresh=true` asks again. |
| `POST /ai/providers/{id}/test` `{"model"}` | Key, reachability and whether the model is offered, without spending tokens: `{"ok", "kind"?, "message"}`. |
| `POST /ai/activate` `{"provider", "model"}` | Which model does the AI work. `"ollama"` switches back to local (the last local model used); a cloud provider needs a saved key. |
| `POST /ai/transcription` `{"backend", "model"}` | `"local"` (Whisper here, the default) or a provider with `stt`. |

A cloud provider's failure fails the job with a message that says what to do
(bad key, out of credit, rate limited, model not offered). Nothing ever falls
back to another provider or to the local model.

## Languages and export

### `GET /languages`

```json
{
  "languages": [{"code": "es", "name": "Spanish", "native": "Español",
                 "can_dub": true, "caption_font": null}],
  "dubbing_available": true
}
```

19 languages. `caption_font` is non-null where burned captions need a specific
font for the script. Chinese gets Microsoft YaHei, Hindi gets Nirmala UI,
because the default Latin fonts render those as empty boxes, permanently, in
the video.

**`dubbing_available` reflects whether the speech engine is importable.** It
is true in installed builds from 1.1.3, which bundle it, and false in a source
checkout without the optional dependency. `can_dub` describes the language, not
your installation. Check both.

### `POST /translate`

```json
{"clip_ids": [80, 81], "languages": ["es", "pt"], "stage": "translate"}
```

`stage` is `translate` (produce text for review) or `export` (write files).
With `export`, `folder` is where they land, and `burn`, `dub`, `subtitles` and
`post_text` choose what gets written. `400 {"detail": "no clips selected"}` on
an empty list.

### `POST /clips/{clip_id}/export`

```json
{"folder": "D:/clips/friday"}
```

Copies the clip out with its final filename. Returns `{"exported": [...]}`, and
**returns 200 with an empty list rather than 404 when the clip does not
exist**. Check the array, not the status.

`POST /export/batch` takes `{"clip_ids": [...], "folder": "..."}`.

Every clip that is copied out gets `exported_at` set to the time of the export.
Clip JSON from `GET /videos/{video_id}/clips` carries `exported_at`, an ISO
timestamp or `""`. Set or clear it by hand with `PATCH /clips/{clip_id}` and
`{"exported": true}` or `{"exported": false}`. Marking a clip that is already
marked keeps its original time.

## Publishing to YouTube

Optional, and **off unless the user has switched it on** in Settings. While it is
off, `GET /youtube/status` returns `{"enabled": false}` and every other endpoint
here returns **404**. A disabled feature looks absent rather than refused. Check
status first; do not treat a 404 as a fault.

Publishing needs the user's own Google Cloud OAuth client. Nothing is proxied
through a server, and **no endpoint here ever returns a token or a client
secret**, in any form.

### Is it available?

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/youtube/status
```

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "backend": "windows-dpapi",
  "has_client": true,
  "connected": true,
  "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload",
             "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly"],
  "playlists_available": false,
  "channel": {"id": "UCxxxxxxxx", "title": "My Channel", "handle": "@mychannel"},
  "settings": {"enabled": true, "privacy": "public", "category_id": "22",
               "made_for_kids": false, "playlists_enabled": false,
               "notify_subscribers": true, "region": "US"},
  "quota": {"uploads_used": 3, "uploads_limit": 100, "remaining": 97, "resets_at": ""}
}
```

`quota` counts **uploads**, not units. Since June 2026 `videos.insert` has its own
daily bucket (100 per Google Cloud project) separate from the 10,000-unit pool
the other endpoints share. The count is advisory: two installs sharing one key
cannot see each other, so a 403 from YouTube is always the truth.

### Publish a clip

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/clips/812/publish   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -d '{"title": "The comeback", "description": "No way", "tags": ["gaming"],
       "privacy": "public", "made_for_kids": false}'
```

```json
{"publish_job_id": 4, "render_job_id": null}
```

Returns immediately. Watch the `publish` WebSocket events, or poll
`GET /clips/812/publish`.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `title` | required, 100 characters |
| `description` | 5,000 characters. Timestamps become chapters. |
| `tags` | 500 characters in total, not a count |
| `category_id` | see `GET /youtube/categories` |
| `privacy` | `public` / `unlisted` / `private` |
| `publish_at` | RFC 3339 with an offset. Forces `privacy` to `private`. |
| `made_for_kids` | YouTube requires an explicit answer |
| `contains_synthetic_media` | altered/synthetic-content disclosure |
| `license` | `youtube` or `creativeCommon` |
| `embeddable`, `public_stats_viewable`, `notify_subscribers` | booleans |
| `default_language`, `playlist_id`, `thumbnail` | optional |
| `render_first` | `{start?, end?, render_opts?}`: re-render before uploading |

**`render_first` is how "no manual export" works.** Pass the editor's pending
`render_opts` and the clip is re-rendered through the ordinary `render` job
first, then uploaded. Omit it and the existing rendered file is used as-is.
Either way the clip's own `render_opts` are never modified. The project stays
editable.

### Scheduling

Send `publish_at`. The video is uploaded **now**, set private, and YouTube
publishes it at that time. There is no local timer and nothing has to stay
running; once the call returns, this app has no further part in it.

Must be at least 15 minutes ahead, and must carry an offset (`...Z` or
`+01:00`). A bare local time is rejected rather than guessed at.

### Publishing state

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/clips/812/publish
```

```json
{
  "upload": {"clip_id": 812, "youtube_id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ", "privacy": "public",
             "actual_privacy": "private", "state": "locked_private",
             "publish_at": "", "channel_title": "My Channel"},
  "job": null
}
```

**Compare `privacy` against `actual_privacy`.** When they differ and `state` is
`locked_private`, YouTube overrode the request, which is what happens to every
upload from a Google Cloud project that has not passed YouTube's compliance
audit. It is permanent and cannot be undone in Studio. Surface it; do not report
success.

`state` is one of `uploaded`, `locked_private`, `rejected`, `failed`.

### The rest

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PATCH /youtube/settings` | enable/disable and publishing defaults |
| `PUT`/`DELETE /youtube/credentials` | install or remove the user's OAuth client |
| `POST`/`GET /youtube/connect` | start the browser consent, then poll it |
| `POST /youtube/disconnect` | revoke and forget the token |
| `GET /youtube/categories?region=US` | assignable categories |
| `GET /youtube/playlists` | needs the full `youtube` scope (opt-in) |
| `GET /youtube/uploads?limit=50` | publishing history |
| `POST /publish/{job_id}/cancel` | cancel an upload in flight |
| `GET /clips/{id}/frame?t=12.5` | a JPEG frame, for a thumbnail picker |
| `POST /clips/{id}/thumbnail` | choose a thumbnail by `path` or by `t` |

Of these, `GET /youtube/status`, `POST /clips/{id}/publish` and
`GET /clips/{id}/publish` are **supported**; the rest exist to serve the Settings
screen and may change with it.

### One thing that will surprise you

An upload interrupted by a crash or a quit is marked `interrupted` and is
**never retried automatically**. From the outside there is no way to tell whether
YouTube finished receiving the file, and a retry that guesses wrong posts the
video to someone's channel twice. Ask the user to check their channel instead.

## Streamer integrations

For a tool that sits next to a livestream, such as the Clips Kitty OBS Plugin.

- **Your tool** decides the stream has really ended, then hands it over.
- **Clips Kitty** finds the VOD the platform publishes afterwards, queues it once,
  and reports progress in terms a small dock can show.

Clips Kitty does not need to be running while the stream is live. Launch it
after the stream, wait for `GET /health`, then post the stream.

### `POST /integrations/streams`

```json
{
  "session_id": "3f2a9c1e-7b64-4d8a-9e21-5c0b6a1f4d77",
  "source": "obs",
  "platform": "twitch",
  "channel": "yourchannel",
  "started_at": 1757790000,
  "ended_at": 1757801400,
  "preset": "standard"
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `session_id` | Yours: 8 to 64 letters, digits and hyphens. A UUID works. Posting the same id again returns the existing stream and creates nothing. |
| `platform` | `twitch`, `youtube` or `kick`. |
| `channel` | The channel handle, without `@`. Needed to find the VOD automatically. |
| `started_at`, `ended_at` | Unix seconds, as your tool saw them. The VOD is matched by start time. |
| `preset` | An `id` from `GET /integrations/presets`. |

Returns the stream, as below, plus `"created": true` or `false`.

### `GET /integrations/streams/{session_id}`

```json
{
  "session_id": "3f2a9c1e-7b64-4d8a-9e21-5c0b6a1f4d77",
  "source": "obs", "platform": "twitch", "channel": "yourchannel",
  "started_at": 1757790000.0, "ended_at": 1757801400.0, "preset": "standard",
  "state": "processing",
  "vod_url": "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2869889709", "video_id": "tw_2869889709",
  "job_id": 212, "waiting_behind": 0, "error": "",
  "progress": {"stage": "analyze", "label": "Finding the best moments",
               "percent": 57, "eta_seconds": 1480, "elapsed_seconds": 1930}
}
```

| `state` | Meaning | Extra fields |
|---|---|---|
| `waiting_for_vod` | Looking for the VOD every 5 minutes, for up to 2 hours after the stream ended. | |
| `needs_link` | It can't look (Kick, or no channel name) or didn't find the VOD. `error` says which, in words a streamer can read. Post the link. | |
| `queued` | In the queue. | `waiting_behind`: videos ahead of it. `queue_paused`: `true` while it waits for someone to press Start. |
| `processing` | Running. | `progress`: stage, label, percent and `eta_seconds` (`null` for the first few percent). |
| `complete` | Done, or that VOD had already been processed. | `clips`: how many were made. |
| `error` | The job failed, or the queue was full. | `error` for the streamer, `details` for a log. |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled here, or removed from the queue in the app. | |

Poll it every few seconds while a dock is open. It reads the queue live, so it
never goes stale.

**It never starts other videos.** Clips Kitty does not start processing on its
own; the queue starts stopped. A stream you hand over counts as the go-ahead for
that stream only.
- **Nothing else waiting, queue stopped:** the queue starts.
- **Other videos already waiting:** it stays stopped and `queue_paused` is
  `true`. Tell the user to press Start in Clips Kitty.

The percentages use the same stage weights as the app, so a dock and the app
never disagree about the same job.

### `POST /integrations/streams/{session_id}/link`

```json
{"url": "https://kick.com/yourchannel/videos/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"}
```

For `needs_link`: queues that link instead. Once the stream is queued,
processing or complete, posting again returns it unchanged.

### `DELETE /integrations/streams/{session_id}`

Removes a queued job, or cancels a running one, and marks the stream
`cancelled`. A finished stream is left as it is.

### `GET /integrations/presets`

```json
[
  {"id": "standard", "name": "Standard", "description": "Vertical clips with captions.", "options": {}},
  {"id": "podcast", "name": "Podcast", "description": "Letterboxed framing for multi-camera podcasts, without subject tracking.", "options": {"podcast": true}},
  {"id": "long_clips", "name": "Long clips", "description": "Clips between 61 and 180 seconds long.", "options": {"long_clips": true}},
  {"id": "highlights", "name": "Stream highlights", "description": "A horizontal highlights video of the stream.", "options": {"longform": {"mode": "highlights"}}}
]
```

Named bundles of options `POST /jobs` already accepts. Show `name` and
`description`, and send `id`.

### Publishing a batch: plan first, then execute

`POST /publish/plan` works out what publishing a set of clips would do and
**creates nothing**:

```json
{"clip_ids": [80, 81, 82], "start_at": "2026-09-18T12:00:00-05:00", "every_hours": 1}
```

```json
{"items": [{"clip_id": 80, "title": "...", "description": "...",
            "privacy": "private", "publish_at": "2026-09-18T17:00:00Z"}],
 "warnings": []}
```

The description is resolved exactly as the worker will build it, standing block
and hashtags included, so the preview is the truth rather than an approximation.
Scheduled items come back **private**: YouTube rejects `publishAt` on anything
else, and flips them public itself at the time.

Omit `start_at` and `every_hours` to upload as soon as each is ready. An interval
without a start is refused, as is a start inside the 15 minute lead time, because
a batch must not slip past a check a single upload has to pass.

`warnings` is where a plan bigger than today's remaining quota says so, before
anything is spent.

`POST /publish/plan/execute` takes the items back and creates one ordinary
publish job per clip:

```json
{"started": [{"clip_id": 80, "publish_job_id": 12}],
 "skipped": [{"clip_id": 81, "reason": "This clip has no rendered file yet."}]}
```

**One clip's problem never costs the batch.** Titles are optional on the way
back: an agent that only moved the schedule does not have to repeat metadata it
never touched, and the clip's own title is used.

### Thumbnails made on this machine

`POST /clips/{clip_id}/thumbnail/generate?count=3` looks through the clip for
frames with a face in them, crops each to 16:9 around the face, burns the clip's
hook across the bottom and writes up to four candidates.

```json
{"generated": 3}
```

**Zero is a normal answer**, not an error: a clip with no readable frame gets
none, and the three fixed suggestions (a quarter, half and three quarters in)
are still there. Everything degrades rather than fails, so a missing face
cascade means a centre crop and a machine with no usable font means no burned
text.

Fetch one with `GET /clips/{clip_id}/thumbnail/generated/{index}`, where index 0
is the best-ranked. Keep one with the normal chooser:

```json
{"generated": 0}
```

`POST /clips/{clip_id}/thumbnail` takes exactly one of `image` (base64),
`t` (seconds into the clip) or `generated` (an index). Candidates are replaced
each time you generate, so an index only refers to the most recent run.

Nothing here calls out to anything: the faces come from the Haar cascades
already bundled for the tracker, the frames from the bundled FFmpeg's decoder,
and the type from a font already on the machine.

## Watched channels

Clips Kitty watches a YouTube, Twitch or Kick channel. When the channel posts,
Clips Kitty queues the video exactly once, like a pasted link, and then
publishes the clips through WoopSocial, asks first, or leaves them alone,
depending on the watch's settings. This is what the Watch page in the app uses.

Nothing happens until automation is switched on (`PATCH /automation`) and the
watch is enabled. Watching only happens while Clips Kitty is running. Anything
posted while it was closed is found on the next look, and the watch's `backlog`
choice decides what happens to it.

How each channel is read:

- **YouTube:** the channel's RSS feed. If the feed fails or comes back empty,
  the uploads playlist through yt-dlp.
- **Twitch:** past broadcasts, through yt-dlp.
- **Kick:** Kick's own channel videos endpoint. It is unofficial; if it stops
  answering, the watch's `last_error` says so.

### `GET /automation` · `PATCH /automation`

```json
{"enabled": true, "delete_sources": false, "interval_minutes": 15, "watches": 2,
 "watching": 1,
 "presets": [{"id": "standard", "name": "Standard", "description": "...", "options": {}}]}
```

PATCH takes either field, or both:

- `enabled`: switch watching on or off.
- `delete_sources`: delete each watched video's download once its clips are
  published. The clips and the library entry stay, and videos no watch queued
  are never touched.

The interval comes from `poll_interval_minutes` in settings.yaml, and is never
less than 5 minutes.

### `POST /automation/watches`

```json
{"platform": "youtube", "channel": "https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips",
 "publish": {"mode": "auto", "platforms": ["youtube", "tiktok"]}}
```

`channel` accepts a channel link, an `@handle` or a bare name. `publish` is
optional and takes the same fields as the watch's `publish` below, so a
hands-off channel is one request. A YouTube channel
is resolved to its `UC...` id, so the handle and the id name the same watch.
Returns the watch plus `"created": true`, or `false` if the channel was already
watched. A channel that can't be found or read returns 400 with a message a
person can read.

The first look records everything already on the channel with status
`earlier`. Adding a channel never queues its back catalogue.

### `GET /automation/watches` · `PATCH` / `DELETE /automation/watches/{id}`

```json
{
  "id": 1, "platform": "youtube", "channel_key": "UC0123456789abcdefABCDEF",
  "name": "Some Channel", "enabled": true,
  "preset": "standard", "options": {"max_clips": 5},
  "publish": {"mode": "auto", "platforms": ["youtube", "tiktok"], "per_day": 5,
              "gap_hours": 1, "day_start": "09:00",
              "hashtags": ["creatorname", "twitch"], "ai_hashtags": true, "footer": "",
              "overrides": {"youtube": {"privacy": "private"},
                            "tiktok": {"privacyLevel": "PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE", "allowDuet": false}}},
  "backlog": "newest", "min_minutes": 3,
  "last_ok_poll_at": 1790190000.0, "next_poll_at": 1790190900.0, "last_error": "",
  "counts": {"baseline": 15, "queued": 2, "skipped": 1},
  "creator": {"id": 7, "name": "Some Channel", "learning": true, "videos": 2, "facts": 23}
}
```

`creator` is the creator profile the channel's videos learn into, the one the
app's Creators page shows. It is made when the channel is added, so
it is there before the first video, and every video the watch queues is
learned into it, whatever the download calls the channel. `videos` counts the
finished ones and `facts` what has been learned from them (facts and
storylines). It is `null` for a YouTube channel whose name could not be read.
Removing the watch keeps the profile and what it learned.

PATCH takes any of the following, and changes only what it is sent:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | Whether this watch is looked at. |
| `preset` | An `id` from `GET /automation` (the same presets as integrations). |
| `options` | The same per-video options as `PATCH /jobs/{id}`, validated the same way. |
| `publish.mode` | `off`: leave the clips alone. `ask`: stop at "ready to publish" (the default). `auto`: publish as soon as the clips exist, and retry on failure (see below). |
| `publish.platforms` | Lower-case names of connected WoopSocial platforms. With none chosen, an automatic watch asks instead. |
| `publish.max_posts` | How many of each video's clips to post, best-scoring first. `0` (the default) posts every clip; the rest stay in the library. |
| `publish.spread` | `true` (the default) spaces posts on the daily budget below. `false` posts each clip the moment it is made, like the Publish dialog with "Space them out" off; pair it with a small `max_posts`. |
| `publish.per_day`, `publish.gap_hours` | A daily budget, queued behind everything already scheduled. WoopSocial's free plan allows about 5 YouTube posts a day. |
| `publish.day_start` | Local `"HH:MM"` for each day's first post, or `""` to start as soon as the scheduler allows. |
| `publish.hashtags` | The creator's own, set once. They lead every caption, ahead of the AI's, so nothing trims them off. |
| `publish.ai_hashtags` | `false` leaves out the hashtags the AI chose, so only the ones above are used. |
| `publish.footer` | Optional text under each caption. Links and "clipped from" wording can get TikTok posts flagged as unoriginal content. |
| `publish.overrides` | Per platform, the fields WoopSocial takes: `youtube.privacy` (`public`, `unlisted`, `private`); `tiktok.privacyLevel` (`PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE`, `FOLLOWER_OF_CREATOR`, `MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS`, `SELF_ONLY`) and the booleans `allowComment`, `allowDuet`, `allowStitch`, `isYourBrand`, `isBrandedContent`; `instagram.postType` (`REEL`, `STORY`); `facebook.postType` (`REEL`, `VIDEO`, `STORY`); `pinterest.pinterestBoardId`. |
| `backlog` | What to do when several videos appeared while Clips Kitty wasn't watching: `newest` (default), `all`, `day` (the last 24 hours) or `none`. Videos that aren't taken are listed as `skipped`, never dropped. |
| `min_minutes` | Shorter videos (Shorts) are skipped. |

`DELETE` stops watching and forgets the watch's list. Jobs and clips it
produced stay in the library.

### `GET /automation/activity`

What the watcher is doing right now, and its last steps, newest first. The
Watched channels page shows this as its live panel.

```json
{
  "now": {"state": "busy", "text": "Making clips of \u201cStream highlights\u201d",
          "progress": {"stage": "analyze", "label": "Finding the best moments",
                       "percent": 57, "eta_seconds": 1480, "elapsed_seconds": 1930}},
  "watching": 2, "next_check_at": 1790195678.5,
  "events": [{"at": 1790194778.5, "text": "Queued \u201cStream highlights\u201d for clipping",
              "kind": "queued"}]
}
```

`now.state` is `off`, `watching`, `waiting` (a video is in the queue) or `busy`
(checking a channel, clipping, or sending clips). `kind` is one of `found`,
`queued`, `done`, `posted`, `waiting`, `retry`, `error` or `info`. The steps
are kept in memory, so a restart starts the list afresh; every `automation`
WebSocket event is a cue to read this again.

### `GET /automation/slots?per_day=5&gap_hours=1&day_start=09:00&count=3`

When the next posts would go out with those settings, after everything already
scheduled. It reserves nothing; the Watched channels page shows it as a preview.

```json
{"times": ["2026-09-24T13:00:00+00:00", "2026-09-24T14:00:00+00:00",
           "2026-09-24T15:00:00+00:00"], "already_scheduled": 4}
```

Returns 400 with the reason when the settings cannot work, such as 10 posts
3 hours apart, which does not fit in a day.

### `POST /automation/watches/{id}/check`

Look at the channel now instead of waiting for the next interval.

### `GET /automation/items?watch_id=`

The videos a watch has seen, newest first.

```json
{
  "id": 7, "watch_id": 1, "platform": "youtube", "video_id": "XM04mbymDsE",
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM04mbymDsE", "title": "...",
  "published_at": 1790184627.0, "detected_at": 1790185000.0,
  "status": "complete", "reason": "", "job_id": 214,
  "publish_state": "done", "publish_error": "", "clips": 6,
  "deliveries": [{"clip_id": 901, "platform": "youtube", "state": "published",
                  "post_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
                  "scheduled_for": "2026-09-24T13:00:00+00:00", "error": ""}]
}
```

| `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `earlier` | Already on the channel when the watch was added. |
| `waiting_for_video` | Live, premiering or still processing on the platform. Checked again every 15 minutes, for up to a week. `reason` says which. |
| `waiting_for_queue` | Ready, but the queue is full. |
| `queued` · `processing` · `complete` · `failed` · `cancelled` | Read live from the video's job, as in `GET /integrations/streams/{session_id}`, with the same extra fields. |
| `skipped` | Set aside. `reason` says why: too short, posted while Clips Kitty wasn't watching, already clipped, members-only. |

`publish_state` is empty until the clips exist. Then it is one of:

- `off`: publishing is off for this watch.
- `ask`: waiting to be told. `publish_error` says why if an automatic publish
  could not start, for example WoopSocial not being set up.
- `publishing`
- `done`

`deliveries` holds one row per clip and platform. Its state is `sending`,
`queued`, `processing`, `published`, `failed` or `skipped`.

**Hands-off retries.** For a watch whose `publish.mode` is `auto`, a failure
is tried again instead of waiting for a person, since nobody may be at the PC:

- **A failed download or processing run** is re-queued (the same job) after
  30 minutes and then after 3 hours. `retries` counts these, and `retry_at` is
  when the next one is due (unix seconds, 0 when none is scheduled).
- **A publish that could not start** because WoopSocial was unreachable, busy
  or rate limiting is tried every 15 minutes, 6 times, then falls back to
  `ask`. `publish_attempts` and `publish_retry_at` track this. Setup problems,
  such as no key, no platforms or an unconnected account, go to `ask` at once.
- **Posts a platform rejected** are sent again after 6 hours and after 24
  hours. `delivery_retries` counts these. Only the rejected ones go; nothing
  published or on its way is ever sent twice.

`source_freed` is 1 once the video's download was deleted (`delete_sources`), and 2 if there was none to delete.

### `POST /automation/items/{id}/queue`

Clip a video that was set aside (`earlier` or `skipped`). The person asking is
the go-ahead, so the minimum length does not apply. A video that is still live
waits as `waiting_for_video`.

### `POST /automation/items/{id}/publish`

Publish a finished video's clips with its watch's settings. This is both the
answer to `ask` and the retry for failed deliveries. Only clips not already
sent, or on their way, to a platform go out, so pressing it twice never posts
anything twice. It returns at once; the upload runs in the background.
Returns 409 until the clips exist.

### `POST /automation/items/{id}/skip`

Set aside a video that hasn't been queued yet, or decline an `ask`.

## MCP: let an AI agent drive it

Clips Kitty ships an **MCP server**, so Claude, Cursor or any MCP client can use the
endpoints above in plain language: queue a stream, follow the job, read the clips it
chose, export one. It is a translation layer over this same API, talking to the running
engine on `127.0.0.1:8765`, and it needs no API key of any kind, because the model that
picks the clips is the one on this machine, or a cloud model the user chose in Settings →
AI on their own key, which the MCP client never sees.

```bash
claude mcp add clips-kitty -- python main.py mcp
```

Installed builds ship the engine as `api.exe` in the app's `resources\backend` folder, so
the command there is `api.exe mcp`. `CLIPS_STUDIO_API` overrides the address if the engine
is on another port.

Thirteen tools. Processing: `queue_video`, `queue_local_file`, `job_status`,
`queue_status`, `list_videos`, `list_clips`, `clip_captions`, `export_clip`,
`engine_status`. Publishing: `youtube_status`, `publish_plan`,
`publish_plan_execute`, `publish_status`.

The publishing tools are deliberately two steps. `publish_plan` returns a
proposal and says in its own output that nothing has been uploaded; an agent is
told to get a clear yes before calling `publish_plan_execute`. Uploads cannot be
taken back and each one spends the user's daily quota.

stdio only, newline-delimited JSON-RPC, protocol version `2025-06-18` (an older version
from the client is accepted and echoed back). **No dependency was added for it**: the
transport is standard library in `server/mcp.py`, because requirements.txt is pinned per
line and an SDK would also mean a new hidden import and a re-frozen backend.

The tools carry the traps in their own output, since an agent reads nothing else: a
`job_id` of `null` means "not queued" rather than "failed", an unknown video id returns an
empty clip list rather than a 404, and a paused queue looks exactly like a stalled app.

An agent skill for clients that support them is in [`skills/clips-kitty/`](../skills/clips-kitty/).

## WebSocket events

```
ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws
```

Connect and listen. The server never expects a message from you. Six event
types:

```json
{"type": "queue"}
{"type": "job", "job_id": 149, "job_type": "process", "status": "running", "title": "Friday stream", "remaining": 2}
{"type": "progress", "job_id": 149, "stage": "transcribe", "video_id": "aB3dEfGhIjK"}
{"type": "model_pull", "tag": "gemma3:12b", "status": "done"}
{"type": "publish", "publish_job": 4, "clip_id": 812, "stage": "publish", "phase": "upload", "fraction": 0.42, "message": "Uploading to YouTube"}
{"type": "automation"}
```

- **`queue`** carries no data. It means "something changed, re-fetch
  `GET /queue`". You will see it often; it is the cheapest way for the server
  to stay honest without duplicating the queue in the event stream.
- **`job`** fires on status transitions. `error` is present when it failed.
- **`progress`** is the pipeline talking. `stage` moves through `download`,
  `downloaded`, `converting source to H.264`, `transcribe`, `analyze`,
  `render`, `done`. Render events carry `clip` and `total`.
  **`job_id` is `null` for prefetch downloads**, which belong to a future job,
  not the running one: never attribute them to the current job.
- **`model_pull`** is download progress for `POST /models/pull`.
- **`automation`** carries no data, like `queue`: a watch found something or
  moved a video along. Re-fetch `GET /automation/items`.
- **`publish`** is a YouTube upload. `phase` moves through `prepare`, `upload`,
  `metadata`, then one of `done` / `failed` / `cancelled`. The terminal one
  also sets `terminal` to the same value, and `done` carries `youtube_id`,
  `url`, and any `warnings`. A later `checked` event may arrive about a minute
  after `done` if YouTube rejected the video or locked it to private.
  **It is deliberately not a `job` event**: publish jobs live in their own
  table and have nothing to do with the video pipeline's progress, so a client
  tracking pipeline state should ignore `publish` entirely.

Events are dropped rather than queued for a slow client (a 200-event buffer per
connection). Treat the WebSocket as a hint to re-read state, not as the state
itself.

## A complete example

**[`examples/drive_the_api.py`](../examples/drive_the_api.py) is a working
program** that walks the whole path: preflight, submit, follow the WebSocket,
read the clips, and it is kept running as part of the repo:

```bash
python main.py serve                                  # in another terminal
python examples/drive_the_api.py                      # preflight only
python examples/drive_the_api.py --url https://twitch.tv/videos/123456789
python examples/drive_the_api.py --file "D:/footage/stream.mp4"
```

The shorter version below is the same idea in one file with polling instead of
a WebSocket. It was run end to end against a live instance.

```python
"""Queue a video and wait for its clips. Requires: pip install requests"""

import time
import requests

API = "http://127.0.0.1:8765"
URL = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3dEfGhIjK"

# 1. Can it actually work right now?
pre = requests.get(f"{API}/health/preflight", timeout=10).json()
blocking = [c for c in pre["checks"] if c["blocking"] and not c["ok"]]
if blocking:
    raise SystemExit("not ready: " + "; ".join(f"{c['name']}: {c['fix']}" for c in blocking))

# 2. Submit. A null job_id is an answer, not a failure.
r = requests.post(f"{API}/jobs", json={"url": URL}, timeout=30).json()
if r.get("already_processed"):
    video_id = r["video_id"]
    print(f"already done: {video_id}")
else:
    job_id = r["job_id"]
    print(f"queued job {job_id}")

    # 3. Poll. The WebSocket is nicer; this keeps the example to one file.
    while True:
        job = requests.get(f"{API}/jobs/{job_id}", timeout=10).json()
        print(f"  {job['status']}")
        if job["status"] in ("done", "failed"):
            break
        time.sleep(15)

    if job["status"] == "failed":
        log = requests.get(f"{API}/jobs/{job_id}/log", timeout=10).json()
        raise SystemExit(job["error"] + "\n" + log["log"][-2000:])
    video_id = job["video_id"]

# 4. Read the clips.
clips = requests.get(f"{API}/videos/{video_id}/clips", timeout=30).json()
for c in sorted(clips, key=lambda c: -c["score"]):
    print(f"{c['score']:3}  {c['start_s']:8.1f}s  {c['title']}")
    print(f"     {API}/media/{c['id']}")
```

The same thing in one line, for a video that is already processed:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/videos/aB3dEfGhIjK/clips \
  | python -c "import json,sys; [print(c['score'], c['title']) for c in json.load(sys.stdin)]"
```

## Gotchas

Collected because each one has cost somebody time:

1. **`POST /jobs` can return `{"job_id": null}`.** Already processed or already
   queued. Check the field, not the status code.
2. **`GET /videos/{unknown}/clips` returns `200 []`.** A typo looks like a video
   with no clips.
3. **`POST /clips/{id}/export` returns 200 for a clip that does not exist.**
   Check `exported`.
4. **`HEAD /media/{id}` is a 405.** Use a range request.
5. **A paused queue is invisible** unless you read `paused`. It persists across
   restarts.
6. **Cancelling is cooperative.** The job keeps running to the next stage
   boundary.
7. **A source checkout and an installed build have different libraries** on the
   same machine, and both want port 8765.
8. **`dubbing_available` and `can_dub` are different questions**: one is
   your installation, the other is whether the language has a voice at all.
9. **One worker, one video at a time.** GPU contention makes parallel jobs
   pointless on consumer hardware, so a queued job waits. That is not a hang.
10. **No pagination.** `GET /videos` returns everything.

## Building something?

- **Get it listed:** add it to [PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md) with a pull request,
  so people can find it.
- **Need an internal endpoint?** Open an issue saying what you are building. The
  fastest way to get one promoted to supported is for somebody to need it.

For changing the app itself rather than building beside it, see
[EXTENDING.md](EXTENDING.md): adding a language, a platform, an AI model or an
export format. [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) explains how the pipeline
fits together.
