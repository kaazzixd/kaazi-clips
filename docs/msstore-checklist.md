# Microsoft Store 0.1.2: first submission checklist

Work top to bottom. Everything above the line is done; everything below needs
you, mostly because it needs a Partner Center account only you can create.

Full instructions for each step are in [MSSTORE.md](MSSTORE.md).

## Done

- [x] **Existing installer untouched**: `win.target` is unchanged, so
      `python scripts/build_installer.py` produces exactly what it did before
- [x] **Config no longer written into the install directory**: would have made
      model switching fail inside an MSIX package (`core/paths.py`)
- [x] **Packaged app verified to launch**: window, backend and bundled Ollama
      all come up
- [x] **appx target added** (`ui/electron-builder.yml`), with `runFullTrust` as
      the only capability
- [x] **Build script**: `python scripts/build_msix.py`
- [x] **Version mapping**: 0.1.2 → package `1.1.2.0`, verified monotonic past
      the 1.0.0 boundary
- [x] **Store tiles generated**: `python scripts/build_appx_assets.py`
- [x] **Updates are distribution-aware**. A Store copy never runs the NSIS
      updater
- [x] **Donations open in the system browser** on Store builds (policy 10.8.2)
- [x] **Privacy policy published**: required by policy 10.5.1, and Partner
      Center will not accept a submission without the URL
- [x] **Store listing copy drafted**. [store-listing.md](store-listing.md)
- [x] **Certification notes drafted**: in MSSTORE.md, covering the first-run
      model download that would otherwise confuse a tester

---

## Needs you

### Account and identity

- [x] Developer account created at **<https://storedeveloper.microsoft.com>**
      (free; that URL specifically, or you get the old paid flow, if you are
      asked for a registration fee, you are in the legacy flow, so back out)
- [x] Publisher display name settled: **Clips Kitty**. It is public and cannot
      be changed later, and it is not a personal name, so the listing does not
      identify the account holder.
- [x] Identity verified (government ID + selfie)
- [x] Product name reserved: **Apps and games → New product → MSIX or PWA app**
- [x] Three values copied from **General → View product identity** into the
      `appx:` block of `ui/electron-builder.yml`: done, and recorded in
      MSSTORE.md so a future release need not go looking

`scripts/build_msix.py` refuses to run until those are filled in.

### Build and test

- [x] Windows Developer Mode on (*Settings → System → For developers*)
- [x] `python scripts/build_msix.py` completes
- [x] `AppxManifest.xml` shows `1.1.2.0`, `ProcessorArchitecture="x64"`,
      `runFullTrust` and nothing else: verified by reading the manifest out of
      the built package
- [x] Package signed and installed locally: `python scripts/sign_msix.py`,
      then the two commands it prints. No Windows SDK needed.
- [x] Installed package launches (window, engine and bundled Ollama all start)
- [ ] Import a video, process it, export: **not done end to end in the
      package**; only the launch and model paths were exercised
- [x] Model switching works **inside the package**: `/models/activate`
      returns 200 and the choice persists. It returned **500** before the
      config fix, so this is the one that mattered.
- [ ] Restart, uninstall, reinstall
- [x] Nothing written into the package directory: settings land in
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Clips Studio\settings.yaml`, confirmed after a switch
- [ ] Windows App Certification Kit passes: **cannot run here**, `appcert.exe`
      ships with the Windows SDK which is not installed. Optional, but it
      catches manifest problems before Microsoft's testers do.

### Resubmitting after a listing-only rejection

The 2026-08-24 review (`9NB6XT7DSQZZ`) failed on **one** thing: policy 10.1.3,
search terms containing "YouTube" and "Twitch". A Microsoft report lists every
issue it found, so everything else: package, screenshots, age rating, pricing,
declarations: was acceptable and **carries over in Partner Center**.

So a listing-only rejection needs only:

- [ ] Search terms replaced (all seven: see `store-listing.md`)
- [ ] Description and feature bullets repasted, if they changed
- [ ] Publishing still set to **manual**
- [ ] Submit

**Do not re-upload or version-bump the package.** It was not what failed, and
the version only has to increase above what is *published*: nothing is.

The full list below is for a first submission.

### Submission

- [ ] Pricing: **Free**
- [ ] Markets: all
- [ ] Discoverability: available and discoverable in the Store
- [ ] Category: primary **Photo + video**, secondary **Multimedia design →
      Photo + video production**. NOT "Multimedia design → Video editing",
      that subcategory does not exist, and Multimedia design is for graphics
      and art rather than video. See MSSTORE.md.
- [ ] Privacy policy URL:
      `https://kaazzixd.github.io/kaazi-clips/privacy.html`
- [ ] System requirements entered: **16 GB RAM minimum**, x64, Windows 10 1809+
- [ ] Product declaration: **live generative AI** ticked (policy 11.16)
- [ ] Product declaration: **third-party purchase API** ticked, for the PayPal
      donate link (policy 10.8.2)
- [ ] Age rating questionnaire completed
- [ ] Package uploaded (`release/*.appx`)
- [ ] Listing: description, feature bullets, search terms
- [x] Four screenshots ready in `docs/store-screenshots/`: dashboard and
      queue from the Store build, models and settings from the dev build. None
      show a face, a video title or a channel name.
- [ ] 1:1 box art uploaded: `docs/store-art/box-art-1x1.png`
- [ ] 2:3 poster art uploaded: `docs/store-art/poster-art-2x3.png` (this is
      what the Store shows in most browsing surfaces)
- [ ] Certification notes pasted in
- [ ] **Publishing set to manual, not automatic**, so you read the
      certification report before it goes live
- [ ] Submitted

### After it passes

- [ ] Certification report read
- [ ] Published
- [ ] Store link added to the README and the website,
      `https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NB6XT7DSQZZ` (404s until it publishes)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` notes that 0.1.2 is on the Store

## Not blocking, but worth doing

- [ ] **winget**. [`packaging/winget/`](../packaging/winget/) is ready to
      submit and needs no account, certificate or certification. Much cheaper
      than the Store and reaches a different audience.
- [ ] Screenshots and a demo video ([#35](../../issues/35)): the listing needs
      screenshots anyway, so this closes two things at once.
