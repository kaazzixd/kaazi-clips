## Ready to submit

```
release\ClipsStudio-1.1.2-x64.appx      7.60 GB
```

Unsigned, which is correct: Microsoft re-signs after certification.

**Verified end to end in the installed package**, not just built:

| Stage | Result |
|---|---|
| Install, launch, engine, bundled Ollama | all start |
| Model switching inside the package | 200, persists (was 500 before the config fix) |
| Transcription, audio and visual analysis | run |
| YOLO detection from the bundled weights | runs, no download attempt |
| Model scoring through the packaged Ollama | runs |
| Rendering | **8 clips, 8 files, 30.8 MB on disk** |
| Settings written outside the read-only package | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Clips Studio\settings.yaml` |

Nothing about the pipeline is unverified any more.

## Everything the submission needs

| | Where |
|---|---|
| Every field, in Partner Center's order | `docs/msstore-submission-sheet.md` |
| Listing copy, features, search terms | `docs/store-listing.md` |
| Four screenshots | `docs/store-screenshots/` |
| Box art, poster, hero | `docs/store-art/` |
| Full walkthrough and reasoning | `docs/MSSTORE.md` |
| Progress tracker | `docs/msstore-checklist.md` |

## Do not forget at submission time

- Tick **live generative AI** (policy 11.16)
- Tick **third-party purchase API** for the PayPal donate link (policy 10.8.2)
- Set **manual publish**, so the certification report can be read first
- Next release uses **Start update** on the same product, never a new one

## Two builds share the version 0.1.2

Deliberate. The Store package was submitted carrying the YOLO weights fix, the
metadata recovery and the Models table fix; the GitHub installer of 0.1.2 does
not have them.

**So the first question on any bug report is where they installed from.**
"Clips Kitty 0.1.2" is not one thing until the next release lines them up
again. The next GitHub release should be 0.1.3 and should include everything in
the CHANGELOG's Unreleased section.

## Worth knowing

- The YOLO download bug **is in the shipped 0.1.2 installer**, confirmed by
  running it, not inferred. Launched from a normal working directory it fails
  with "Download failure ... Retry limit reached"; launched from a folder that
  happens to contain the weights it passes. That is why it reached a release:
  it always works on a developer's machine, because the source tree has the
  file sitting in it.
- Both builds have now been through the same end-to-end test. To repeat it:
  `python tests/assets/make_sample_video.py`, import the result, and lower
  `clips.min_score` so candidates actually render. Launch the app with a
  working directory outside the source tree or the test proves nothing.
- `build\msix-signing\` holds a 7.1 GB signed copy, only needed to reinstall
  locally. Safe to delete; `sign_msix.py` regenerates it.
- The Windows App Certification Kit cannot run here: `appcert.exe` ships with
  the Windows SDK, which is not installed.
