# Examples

Small runnable programs, each showing one way into the codebase. They are
meant to be read and then edited. Copy one, change it, see what happens.

Run them from the repo root.

| | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [`score_a_transcript.py`](score_a_transcript.py) | Clip selection on its own: no video, no rendering, seconds per run |
| [`drive_the_api.py`](drive_the_api.py) | The whole pipeline over HTTP, exactly as the desktop app drives it |
| [`fake_backend.py`](fake_backend.py) | A deterministic stand-in for the model, so scoring runs without Ollama |

## Start here: scoring without a video

```
python examples/score_a_transcript.py --fake
```

No model, no footage, no wait. It scores the sample transcript in
[`../tests/assets/`](../tests/assets/) and prints both the clips it picked
*and* the ones it dropped with the reason.

Drop `--fake` to use the real model from `config/settings.yaml`, which is
what you want when the thing you are changing is the prompt in
`config/prompts/`:

```
python examples/score_a_transcript.py
```

Re-score a stream you have already processed: no re-download, no
re-transcribe:

```
python examples/score_a_transcript.py --transcript data/transcripts/<id>.json
```

That is the loop worth internalising. Selection changes are cheap to test
this way and expensive to test any other way.

## The engine is a server; the app is just a client

```
python main.py serve                       # one terminal
python examples/drive_the_api.py           # another
```

With no arguments it only reports readiness. Give it something to do:

```
python examples/drive_the_api.py --url https://www.twitch.tv/videos/123456
python examples/drive_the_api.py --file "D:/footage/stream.mp4"
```

It submits the job, follows progress over the WebSocket, and lists the
clips. Nothing in it is privileged. The Electron UI makes the same calls.
If you want Clips Kitty to do something on a schedule, or from a bot, or
across a folder of old VODs, this file is the starting point.

## Writing your own

The engine imports cleanly from the repo root, so a script only needs the
root on `sys.path`. Each example does this in its first few lines. From
there:

```python
from analysis.highlights import find_highlights   # pick clips from a transcript
from transcription.transcriber import transcribe  # audio -> segments
from core.state import StateDB                    # the library database
from llm.registry import create_backend           # the configured model
```

Two things to respect, both of which will bite otherwise:

- **Never call `ffmpeg` by bare name.** Use `core.binaries.ffmpeg()`. An
  installed copy ships its own FFmpeg in `_internal/` and has no system one.
- **Never hardcode a data path.** Use `core.paths.resolve_data_dir(config)`.
  A dev checkout writes into the repo; an installed copy writes into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, because Program Files is not writable.

Adding a language, model, platform or export format is a smaller change than
it looks. [`../docs/EXTENDING.md`](../docs/EXTENDING.md) has each one.
