"""Who the streamer is in a gaming video, and where their webcam sits.

TalkNet decides WHO. The streamer is the face that speaks in time with the
audio. Size never picks the person: that is how earlier versions ended up
framing a game character, a portrait or the person in a video being reacted
to (the "largest face" problem TalkNet already fixed in the standard tracker).

Measured on real game streams (scripts/gaming_detect_bench.py, docs/GAMING.md),
TalkNet alone answers "who is speaking in this clip", which is not always the
streamer, so three things sit around it:

- Presence. A face must be on screen for most of the clip to be a candidate.
  TalkNet scores whatever crop it is given, and a face seen for a moment (a
  driver glimpsed through a car window in GTA) scored as confidently as a
  real speaker. A webcam is there the whole time.
- Ranking, not a fixed level. TalkNet's absolute logit moves with how well a
  crop matches its training, so faces are compared against each other (the
  standard tracker does the same). Of the candidates that speak for a real
  share of the loud moments, the most confident speaker wins.
- The video, not one clip. In a reaction the person in the video being
  watched can out-talk the streamer for a whole clip. Across the video,
  though, the streamer is the one speaking from the same spot again and
  again; the people in the content come and go. So the webcam is decided
  from several windows of the video together (video_cam), and each clip
  checks whether that webcam is on screen.

Once the streamer is known, their person box over the clip gives the webcam
box, and its size says whether it is an overlay on the game (a split) or a
camera filling the frame (not a gaming layout; the standard tracker frames
that).

Nobody speaking is an answer too: then there is no webcam, and the caller
falls back to a box the user drew or one saved for the creator. Never to size.

Isolation: imported only when the Gaming / Split-Screen toggle is on. It reuses
the tracker's detector, track matching and TalkNet crop read-only, and
video/tracker.py is not modified.

    A webcam overlay is a rectangle with a hard straight border that stays put

    several frames each side shows up as a line of strong contrast along the
    whole side. Sides move OUT from the streamer (a line well inside their
    own box, like a door frame behind them, is the room; SNAP_BACK allows the
    few pixels a person box overshoots by), to the nearest such line. A side with no clear border keeps the streamer's own edge: showing a
    little less of the webcam beats showing chat beside it. This looks only
    around a box TalkNet already chose; it never goes looking for regions.
