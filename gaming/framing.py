"""Where the streamer's face goes: camera crops placed from the face, clear
of the platforms' own UI.

A camera region is filled by a crop of the webcam cut at the region's shape
(never stretched). Centring that crop on the webcam box cut heads off:
measured on a hero-shooter stream, the top of the streamer's head landed 2 to
26 px from the top of the Short, under TikTok's "Following | For You" bar,
because the webcam box started at the top of the head and the crop was centred.

So the crop is placed from the head instead: centred on it across, and down
so the top of the head lands clear of the region's top edge (HEADROOM) and,
for a region at the top of the Short, clear of the platform's top bar too.
Some streamers sit high in their webcam, with no picture above their head to
show (the same streamer: 22 px). Then the camera picture is moved down within
its region by exactly the shortfall, and a blur of it fills the gap: only when
needed, and only as much as needed. Nothing is decided by size or motion; the
head is the streamer's, already chosen by TalkNet or drawn by the user.

The safe zones are the published design defaults for 1080x1920 (layouts.json);
they vary by device and caption length, so the editor shows them and lets the
platform be chosen.
