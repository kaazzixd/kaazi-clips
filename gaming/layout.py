"""Where each part of a gaming clip comes from and goes. Pure geometry, no pixels.

A layout (a preset in layouts.json) places ELEMENTS on the 1080x1920 canvas:
the streamer's webcam ("cam", and "cam2" for a duo), the game ("game") and a
piece of the game's own UI ("ui": a scoreboard, a kill feed, a speedrun
timer). Each element goes through the same steps:

    canvas -> the region it is assigned -> the source's shape ->
    crop / scale / letterbox -> position

- cover:   the source is cropped to the region's shape and fills it; never
           stretched.
- contain: the whole source box is shown, as big as fits, ANCHORED to the
           region's outer edge (a game on top starts at the top of the Short,
           one at the bottom ends at its bottom), and a blur of it fills the
           rest of that region only. Only the Blurred layout, which is the
           game alone, sits in the middle.

Preset types:
- stack: rows from top to bottom (webcam band, game band, maybe a UI strip),
         the webcam band's height set by the divider; "order" puts the game
         on top instead.
- full:  the game alone (Fullscreen: zoomed to fill; Blurred: whole on a blur).
- pip:   the game fills the Short and the webcam sits over it near the top,
         inside the platforms' safe zone (Small facecam, Circle facecam, Dual).

The game region is never DETECTED: the old attempts looked for the part of
the screen with the most going on, and scrolling chat won every time. It is
the user's drawn box, or a fixed crop that only moves to leave out a known
webcam. Nothing here reads motion, activity or pixel values.
