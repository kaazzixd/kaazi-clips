"""The two calls the pipeline makes when Gaming / Reaction is on.

A clip's settings travel in render_opts["gaming"]:
    cam           normalized [x, y, w, h] of the webcam, or None for none
    by            who decided the webcam:
                    "user"    drawn in the editor for this clip
                    "creator" remembered for this creator from an earlier edit
                    "video"   found across the whole video (prepare)
                    "clip"    to be found in this clip alone (the editor's
                              Split layout on a clip made without the switch)
    preset        the layout (gaming/layouts.json): split, basecam, half,
                  fullscreen, blurred, small_cam, circle_cam, game_ui, mosaic,
                  dual_cam, duo_split. Absent (clips from before layouts):
                  half, with cam_position giving the order.
    order         "cam_top" | "game_top": which goes on top in a stacked layout
    divider       the webcam band's share of the height (each layout's range)
    safe          the platform whose UI the face is kept clear of: tiktok,
                  reels, shorts, all, none (gaming/framing.py)
    game_align    "left" | "center" | "right": where a zoomed game crop sits
    game_box      normalized [x, y, w, h] of the game (or the video being
                  reacted to) drawn by the user, replacing the automatic region
    game_fit      "fit": the game whole, right against the webcam, with blur
                  above the two (clear of the platform's top bar) and below;
                  "fill": zoomed to fill its region
    ui_box        normalized box of a piece of the game's UI (Game UI, Mosaic)
    cam2          a second webcam (Dual facecam, Duo split), drawn by the user
    panels        normalized boxes of the stream's solid panels (a black chat
                  bar, a splits timer) that the game crop keeps out
                  (gaming/panels.py). Absent: looked for when the clip renders
    places        where the user put layers on the Short: {"cam", "cam2", "ui"}
                  -> normalized [x, y, w, h] of the canvas (a facecam keeps
                  its shape; two facecams are always the same size)
    cam_position  from before layouts: "bottom" meant order game_top

prepare(): once per video, before its clips render. The layout remembered for
    the creator, else the streamer's webcam found from several of the video's
    clips together (detect.video_cam).
render(): per clip. Decides this clip's layout and renders it:
    1. a webcam the user drew, or remembered for the creator, wins (as does
       their "no webcam") while somebody is at it. Only evidence in the clip
       overrides a person's choice:
         - the streamer's camera filling the frame (a stream that opens with
           an hour of just chatting, a reaction streamer between videos):
           the standard renderer frames the clip;
         - the webcam somewhere else (it moved between the chatting and the
           game): this clip's own webcam, found as the editor suggests one;
       nothing certain keeps their webcam;
    2. the video's webcam, when somebody is at it in this clip: a split;
    3. otherwise TalkNet on this clip: a camera filling the frame goes to the
       standard renderer, which frames people; with no video-level answer, a
       webcam overlay this clip finds is used; failing that, this clip's own
       webcam as in 1;
    4. otherwise the game fills the screen.

Both are called inside the pipeline's guards: any exception means the
standard renderer takes the clip, the same as with the switch off.
