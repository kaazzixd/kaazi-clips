# Rough VRAM guide for Ollama default (4-bit) quantizations.
#
# ONE axis: what the machine can hold. Every row answers "how much VRAM do you
# have", and recommend_for() hands out exactly these. An earlier version
# appended rows like "Newer Gemma" and "Multilingual" here, which put
# non-hardware values under a "Your hardware" heading and left the note column
# carrying licences, warnings and hardware advice at once. Anything that is not
# a hardware tier belongs in OTHER_MODELS below.
#
# Stays on the Gemma 3 line because that is what has been run against real
# streams here. Newer is not automatically better, and a stranger's first
# launch is the wrong place to discover otherwise.
# One row per tier, no model listed twice. gemma3:4b previously appeared under
# both "CPU only / iGPU" and "6-8 GB VRAM", which reads as a mistake even
# though it is the same correct answer to both.
#
# The Gemma 4 edge builds belong here, not off to one side. e2b and e4b are
# built to run on ordinary local machines, which is precisely this audience —
# treating them as exotic would be wrong.

# NOTE ON TESTING, true of both tables: only gemma:7b, gemma3:4b and gemma3:12b
# have been run against real streams. Everything else is listed because it is a
# sensible size for the hardware and is free to use commercially, not because
# clip quality has been measured with it. They will work — the app talks to all
# of them identically through Ollama — but nobody has checked whether they pick
# better or worse moments.
#
# The other axis: chosen for a reason other than how much VRAM you have.
#
# Licence is called out because this audience monetises its clips. Everything
# here is free to run locally, but the terms differ — Qwen and Mistral are
# Apache-2.0, Phi-4 is MIT, Llama and Gemma carry their own terms that permit
# commercial use with conditions. DeepSeek-R1 is MIT and gpt-oss is Apache-2.0.
# Nemotron's NVIDIA Open Model License allows commercial use with no registration
# and no credit; its attribution notice applies only to redistributing the model
# itself, which nothing here does.
#
# Deliberately absent: Cohere's Aya Expanse and Command-R7B, excellent
# multilingually and licensed CC-BY-NC, so they cannot be used for anything
# anyone earns from. Also GLM-4 9B, whose licence requires registering with
# Zhipu and showing a "Built with glm-4" credit before any commercial use.
