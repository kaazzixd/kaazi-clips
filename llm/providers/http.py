"""The one door every cloud AI request goes through.

Building the headers here, and only here, is what makes two promises
checkable: the user's key travels in a header (never a URL, which would put it
in error messages), and a provider's own headers (OpenRouter's attribution)
are on every request it gets, retries included.

Failures come back as LLMError with a message a creator can act on. A busy or
rate-limited provider is retried a few times, honouring Retry-After; nothing
is ever retried against a different provider.
