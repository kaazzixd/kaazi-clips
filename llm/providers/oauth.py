"""Signing in to a provider instead of pasting a key (OAuth with PKCE).

OpenRouter's flow, for people who have never made an API key: the app sends
the user's own browser to openrouter.ai/auth with a code challenge; they sign
in and approve Kaazi Clips; OpenRouter sends the browser back to the app's
callback on this PC with a one-time code, and the app trades the code and its
verifier for an API key of the user's own, which spends their OpenRouter
credits (POST /auth/keys). No app secret and no registration: the verifier
is the proof, it is made fresh for each sign-in, and it never leaves this PC
until the exchange. The key is then checked and kept exactly as a pasted one
is (server/ai_api.py). The website does the same from the browser
(web/lib/openrouter.ts).
