"""OpenRouter: one key, many providers' models, billed to the user's account.

Every request OpenRouter gets from this app carries the app's attribution
headers, which is how its usage is credited to Kaazi Clips in OpenRouter's app
rankings. They are the app's identity, not a user setting, and they are built
here and nowhere else: SPEC.extra_headers hands them to llm/providers/http.py,
which puts them on every request (chat, models, key check, transcription and
every retry). `video-gen` is the category in OpenRouter's Creative section
that fits; a bare "creative" is not a category and would be dropped.

The website (web/lib/openrouter.ts) sends its own set, with its own origin and
the title "Kaazi Clips Web", from the visitor's browser.
