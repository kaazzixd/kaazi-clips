"""Signing in to an AI plan the user already pays for, instead of an API key.

Only where the provider officially lets a third-party app do it: through the
provider's own documented SDK or sign-in flow, unmodified, with the sign-in
held by that SDK and never seen by Kaazi Clips. ChatGPT, through OpenAI's
Codex, is the one that does today. Anthropic and Google do not allow their
plans outside their own apps (docs/AI-BACKENDS.md has the sources), so they
stay API key only.

A new one is a SignInProvider in catalog.py. The API routes, the settings
card and the pipeline read the catalogue; nothing else changes.
