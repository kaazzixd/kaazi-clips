"""Chronological assembly: keep-ranges -> one 1920x1080 video.

A 3-hour VOD can produce hundreds of keep-ranges; a single FFmpeg filter
graph that size is fragile. Instead each range is cut (GPU-encoded with
identical parameters) and the pieces are joined losslessly with the concat
demuxer — same result, scales safely, and cancellation can land between
segments.
