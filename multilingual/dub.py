"""AI dubbing: speak the translated captions over the clip.

Local and free, like everything else here — Piper runs on the CPU, its
voices are ~60 MB each, and nothing is downloaded until a language is
actually dubbed. Piper is an OPTIONAL dependency: without it the rest of
multilingual publishing works exactly the same and the UI simply doesn't
offer dubbing.

Timing is the hard part of dubbing, not the voice. Translated speech runs
longer than English, so each utterance is synthesized, measured, and (only
when it misses its slot) re-synthesized at an adjusted speaking rate —
Piper stretches phonemes properly, which sounds better than speeding up
audio after the fact. Anything that still doesn't fit keeps its natural
pace rather than turning into chipmunk speech; a slight overlap into a
pause is less jarring.

The original audio stays underneath at low volume so music and room tone
survive. That also means the creator's own voice is faintly audible —
removing it properly needs a source-separation model, which is a heavier
dependency than this stage is worth.
