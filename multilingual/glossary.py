"""Terms that must survive translation unchanged.

A creator's channel name, the games they play, their collaborators and
their catchphrases are the things a translator most often mangles — and
they're exactly what the app already learned into creator_knowledge. This
turns that into a do-not-translate list the translation prompt carries, so
"CreatorName" stays "CreatorName" and a catchphrase renders the same way in
every video instead of drifting per clip.

Read-only against the existing tables: nothing here writes to or changes
creator data.
