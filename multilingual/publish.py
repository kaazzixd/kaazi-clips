"""Turn one finished clip into subtitle tracks for several languages.

Input is what the clip already has — its caption lines and, optionally, the
video file to copy alongside them. Output is new files only:

    my-clip.mp4          (copied when asked)
    my-clip.es.srt       my-clip.es.vtt
    my-clip.fr.srt       my-clip.fr.vtt

That naming is what YouTube expects for per-language caption uploads, so a
creator picks the files up and the platform shows each viewer their own
language. Nothing about the clip itself changes.
