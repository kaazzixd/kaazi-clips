# winget manifests

`winget install ColinGPT9.ClipsKitty`. Accepted into winget-pkgs at 2.0.0
([#425676](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/425676), October 2026); each new
version is an update pull request.

These three files are the whole submission. They point at the installer that
already ships on GitHub Releases, so nothing about the build changes: no
account, no certificate, no certification queue. This is the cheapest
distribution channel the project has.

## Submitting a new version

1. Update `PackageVersion` in all three files, and in
   `ColinGPT9.ClipsKitty.installer.yaml` update `InstallerUrl`,
   `InstallerSha256` and `ReleaseDate`.

   The hash must be the real one for the file at that URL:

   ```bash
   python -c "import hashlib,urllib.request as u; print(hashlib.sha256(u.urlopen('URL').read()).hexdigest().upper())"
   ```

2. Fork [microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) and
   copy the three files to:

   ```
   manifests/c/ColinGPT9/ClipsKitty/<version>/
   ```

3. Validate before opening the pull request:

   ```
   winget validate --manifest manifests/c/ColinGPT9/ClipsKitty/<version>
   winget install --manifest manifests/c/ColinGPT9/ClipsKitty/<version>
   ```

   The second one actually installs it. Do that in a VM or Windows Sandbox
   rather than on your own machine: `scripts/test-install.wsb` is already set
   up for exactly this.

4. Open the pull request. An automated pipeline validates and test-installs it,
   then a moderator reviews.

Alternatively `wingetcreate update ColinGPT9.ClipsKitty --version <v> --urls <url>`
does steps 1 and 2 and opens the pull request for you.

## Two things that could get it rejected

**The installer is a web installer.** `ClipsKitty-Web-Setup-<v>.exe` is under a
megabyte and downloads the payload from Hugging Face when it runs: **6.7 GB as
of 2.0.0**, not the 2 GB this file used to say, because the bundled Ollama
runtime and Whisper weights arrived since. winget itself is fine with that; it
just runs the installer. But the validation pipeline installs the package in a
VM on a timer, and a download that size inside that window is much the most
likely reason for a failed check. If it times out, say so in the pull request;
this is a known situation for large apps and reviewers deal with it regularly. 1.1.4
failed that check (`Validation-Shell-Execute`); 2.0.0, with a 6.7 GB payload, passed it.

**The installer is unsigned.** No code signing certificate exists for this
project yet. winget does not require one, unlike the Microsoft Store's EXE/MSI
route, but SmartScreen will still warn users on first run until the installer
builds reputation.

## Why this exists alongside the Microsoft Store

They are different audiences and different amounts of work. winget reaches
people who install everything from a terminal and costs nothing to maintain.
The Store reaches people who never open one, and costs an MSIX build and a
certification pass per release. See `docs/MSSTORE.md`.

Neither replaces GitHub Releases, which stays the primary channel.
