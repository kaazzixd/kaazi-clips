"""What went wrong, in terms a creator can act on.

The Google client raises HttpError for everything from "your daily upload
allowance is gone" to "YouTube limited your channel" to "your sign-in expired",
and the difference matters enormously: one is worth retrying in ten seconds,
one is worth retrying tomorrow, and one needs the user to click Reconnect.
Guessing wrong means either a retry loop that can double-post a video, or a
dead end that looks like a crash.

classify() turns an API failure into one of these, and every one of them
carries a sentence meant to be shown to the user as-is.
