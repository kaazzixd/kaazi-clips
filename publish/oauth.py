"""The browser half of connecting a YouTube account.

`InstalledAppFlow.run_local_server()` starts a web server, opens a browser, and
blocks until the user finishes consenting — which could be never. That cannot
happen inside an HTTP handler, so it runs on its own thread and the UI polls
for the outcome.

Loopback is the only redirect Google still accepts for desktop apps: the
out-of-band copy-paste flow and custom URI schemes are both retired. The client
secret in a desktop app is not really a secret — Google says as much, since the
binary is on the user's machine — but it is still theirs, so it lives in the
encrypted store rather than in a config file.
