"""Scheduling: converting and checking a publish time.

YouTube owns the schedule. Kaazi Clips uploads the video immediately, marks it
private, and hands YouTube a `status.publishAt`. After that the app has no part
to play — the machine can be switched off and the video still goes out. There
is deliberately no local timer anywhere in this feature.

The actual timezone conversion happens in the browser, which has a full ICU
database and knows that 1:30 AM on a fall-back Sunday happens twice. Python on
Windows has no tz database at all (zoneinfo raises ZoneInfoNotFoundError and
tzdata is not a dependency), so this module only ever handles instants that
already carry an offset.
