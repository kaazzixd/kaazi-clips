"""Upload-Post: one request, several platforms.

The reason this provider exists is the `platform[]` form field. Sending it once
per destination makes a single POST fan out server-side, so a clip reaches
YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and the rest from one upload of the bytes. Looping a
per-platform upload would re-send the video every time and lose the partial
results, which is the whole point of the service.

Stdlib only, like the rest of `publish/`. The tests have to import this on a CI
runner with no third-party HTTP library installed.

Two facts about this API that the code below is shaped around:

* **The host is `https://api.upload-post.com` and every path starts `/api/`.**
  The docs also print the base as `.../api`, but that URL is a 404 — the two
  must never be concatenated.
* **A synchronous upload is cut off at 59 seconds**, which no real clip will
  finish inside. So every upload is sent with `async_upload=true` and the
  result is polled. A desktop app cannot receive their webhooks.
