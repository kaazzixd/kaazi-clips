"""WoopSocial: a second multi-platform publishing provider.

Alongside Upload-Post rather than instead of it. The two do the same job and
a creator should be able to use whichever they already pay for — or, on
WoopSocial's free tier, whichever costs them nothing.

It reaches the same destinations by a different shape, and the differences
are what this module exists to absorb:

* **Two steps, not one.** The clip is uploaded to a media library first
  (`POST /media`), then a post references it by id. Upload-Post takes the
  file and the metadata in a single multipart request.
* **Accounts, not platform names.** A post names `socialAccountId`s, so the
  connected accounts have to be listed and matched to platforms before
  anything can be sent. Upload-Post takes `platform[]=youtube` directly.
* **One parent post, several children.** The fan-out is a `socialAccounts`
  array inside one request, and each child carries its own per-platform
  fields — YouTube's `title` and `privacy` live there, for instance.

Stdlib only, like the rest of `publish/`.
