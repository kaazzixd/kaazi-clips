"""YouTube upload via the YouTube Data API v3.

One-time setup per user (Kaazi Clips walks you through this in Settings):

1. Google Cloud Console -> create project -> enable "YouTube Data API v3"
2. OAuth consent screen -> fill it in -> **Publish app**. Leaving it in
   *Testing* makes Google expire the sign-in every 7 days, so you would have to
   reconnect weekly. "In production" does not mean verified and costs nothing.
3. Credentials -> OAuth client ID -> **Desktop app**
4. Paste the client ID and secret into Settings, or run `python main.py auth`

Quota, as of the 1 June 2026 granular-buckets change: `videos.insert` has its
OWN daily bucket of 100 uploads per API project, separate from the 10,000-unit
pool everything else shares. (Older documentation, and this file until
recently, said an upload cost 1,600 of those 10,000 — that stopped being true
on 4 December 2025, when the cost fell to ~100 units, and stopped being the
right model entirely six months later.) Since every user brings their own Cloud
project, nobody shares a bucket with anyone else.

The one thing no code here can fix: **until an API project passes YouTube's
free compliance audit, YouTube locks every video uploaded through it to
private**, whatever privacy was requested. That lock cannot be appealed and
cannot be undone in Studio — the video has to be uploaded again from an audited
project. So `publish()` reads the privacy back and reports what actually
happened rather than what was asked for.
