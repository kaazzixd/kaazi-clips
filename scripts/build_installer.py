"""Build the Windows installer, end to end.

    python scripts/build_installer.py

Runs the whole chain in order and stops at the first failure with an
explanation rather than a stack trace:

    1. check the build tools are present
    2. fetch FFmpeg, Ollama and the Whisper weights if they aren't vendored yet
    3. freeze the Python engine to build/dist/backend/api.exe
    4. build the Electron front end
    5. wrap both in an NSIS installer -> release/

The result is release/ClipsStudio-Setup-<version>.exe, which installs the app,
the Python engine, FFmpeg, the Ollama runtime, and the YOLO, TalkNet and
Whisper weights together. A creator installs nothing else: the one remaining
download is the language model, which the app pulls itself on first launch
behind a progress bar, because it is 5 GB and the right one depends on their
GPU.

Flags:
    --skip-backend    reuse the frozen backend from a previous run
    --skip-ui         reuse the previously built renderer
    --backend-only    stop after freezing the engine (fast iteration)
