"""Build the Microsoft Store package.

    python scripts/build_msix.py

The sibling of build_installer.py. That script produces the NSIS installer
that ships from GitHub and Hugging Face; this one produces the MSIX/appx
package that goes to Partner Center. They build the same application from the
same source: only the wrapper and two runtime behaviours differ, and those are
decided at runtime in ui/src/main/distribution.ts rather than by compiling
something different.

    1. check the build tools, and Developer Mode
    2. freeze the Python engine (or reuse it with --skip-backend)
    3. build the Electron front end
    4. wrap both in an appx package -> release/

Flags:
    --skip-backend    reuse the frozen backend from a previous run
    --skip-ui         reuse the previously built renderer

WHAT YOU MUST DO FIRST
    Fill in the four placeholders in the `appx:` block of
    ui/electron-builder.yml with the values Partner Center gives you. This
    script refuses to build without them, because a package built on
    placeholder identity cannot be uploaded and finding that out at the upload
    step wastes an hour of packaging.

    docs/MSSTORE.md walks through getting them.

    the first section, which cannot be 0".

    This used to add one to the major, because the app was on 0.x and 0.1.2.0
    is rejected at upload. That produced two version numbers for one release --
    0.1.2 in the app, 1.1.2.0 on the Store -- which is a mapping somebody has
    to remember and get right on every submission.

    The app moved to 1.1.3 to end that. It is deliberately not 1.0.0: the
    Store also requires each submission to be higher than the last, and
    1.1.2.0 is already published, so 1.0.0.0 would be refused. 1.1.3.0 clears
    it and lets the two numbers finally be the same one.

    you last froze it.

    That is not hypothetical. The first Store package built here carried an
    engine two days old, so it was missing the very fix that stops settings
    writes landing inside the read-only package -- and switching models in the
    installed package failed with HTTP 500, which is precisely the bug the fix
    exists to prevent.

    Timestamps, because there is no cheap way to ask the exe what it contains.
    PyInstaller stores modules zlib-compressed inside the executable's PYZ
    archive, so grepping api.exe for a function name finds nothing whether or
    not it is in there -- `resolve_data_dir` has been in core/paths.py for
