"""Regenerate site/sitemap.xml from the pages that actually exist.

    python scripts/build_sitemap.py            # rewrite the sitemap
    python scripts/build_sitemap.py --check    # fail if it is out of date (CI)

Two things a hand-written sitemap gets wrong, both silently. Pages get added
and never listed — roadmap.html and changelog.html were missing the day they
shipped. And `lastmod` rots: a crawler uses it to decide what is worth
re-reading, so a date that never changes is worse than no date, because it
actively says "nothing here has changed".

The dates come from git rather than the filesystem. A fresh clone has today's
mtime on every file, which would tell Google the whole site changed at once.
