"""Download the FFmpeg binaries the installer ships.

Creators don't have FFmpeg and won't install it, so the packaged app carries
its own. This fetches a static Windows build and drops ffmpeg.exe and
ffprobe.exe into vendor/ffmpeg/, where core.binaries looks for them and the
packaging step picks them up.

    python scripts/fetch_ffmpeg.py            # fetch if missing
    python scripts/fetch_ffmpeg.py --force    # re-download

The binaries are NOT committed — they're build inputs, fetched on the
machine that builds the installer.

Licensing note: this pulls a GPL build, because CPU encoding uses libx264
which is GPL. Kaazi Clips only runs FFmpeg as a separate process and does
not link against it, so shipping the unmodified binary alongside the app is
mere aggregation — but the GPL still requires that users can get FFmpeg's
source. vendor/ffmpeg/README-FFMPEG.txt is written next to the binaries with
that offer, and the installer ships it.
