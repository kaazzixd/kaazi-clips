"""Download the Ollama runtime the installer ships.

Ollama runs the language model that scores and titles clips. It used to be the
creator's job: the setup wizard stopped and asked them to go to ollama.com,
download a second installer, run it, and come back. That is the single biggest
thing standing between "downloaded Kaazi Clips" and "made a clip", and it is
the kind of errand people abandon.

So the app carries its own copy. This fetches the standalone Windows build --
a zip, not the ollama.com installer -- and drops it into vendor/ollama/, where
core.binaries looks for it and the packaging step picks it up. The standalone
build matters: it needs no admin rights, edits no PATH, registers no service,
and leaves any Ollama the creator already installed completely alone.

    python scripts/fetch_ollama.py            # fetch if missing
    python scripts/fetch_ollama.py --force    # re-download

The binaries are NOT committed -- they're build inputs, fetched on the machine
that builds the installer.

Licensing note: Ollama is MIT, so shipping it unmodified is straightforward.
MIT still requires the copyright notice and licence text travel with it, so
vendor/ollama/README-OLLAMA.txt is written next to the binaries and the
installer ships it.
