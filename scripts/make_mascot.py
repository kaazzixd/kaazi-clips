"""Write the Kaazi Clips mascot PNGs and the Windows icon.

    python scripts/make_mascot.py

Outputs:
    docs/brand/mascot.png        full body — README, website, merch base
    docs/brand/mascot-head.png   head only — what the icon is cut from
    ui/build/icon.ico            multi-size Windows icon for the installer

The artwork itself lives in `video/mascot_art.py` — edit the numbers there and
re-run this. It moved out of here because `scripts/` is not packaged into the
frozen build, and `video/outro.py` needs the same geometry at runtime to
animate Clippy for the end card. One source, three consumers.
