"""Sign the Store package with a throwaway certificate, so it can be installed.

    python scripts/sign_msix.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The package that goes to Partner Center is deliberately unsigned: Microsoft
    re-signs it with their own certificate after certification, which is why no
    code-signing certificate has to be bought for the Store.

    But Windows will not install an unsigned package, so testing the thing you
    are about to ship means signing it yourself first. That signature is for
    this machine only and has nothing to do with the Store submission -- upload
    the UNSIGNED package from release/, not the one this produces.

WHAT IT NEEDS
    Nothing that is not already here. signtool.exe ships inside electron-builder's
    winCodeSign download, so the Windows SDK is not required, and the certificate
    is made by PowerShell's New-SelfSignedCertificate, which is built into
    Windows. Developer Mode must be on, which it must be to have built the
    package at all.

    Deliberately NOT makecert.exe, which is in that same cache: `makecert -sv`
    opens a GUI password dialog and hangs anything running unattended.

THE ONE RULE
    The certificate subject must equal the `publisher` value in
    ui/electron-builder.yml EXACTLY. Windows refuses the install otherwise, with
    an error that names neither value.
