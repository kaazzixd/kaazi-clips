"""The assistant behind the app's Gemma box.

Type "clip this stream, then upload them an hour apart with #mychannel" and a
local model works out which of the engine's own tools to call, in order, and
does it. The tools are exactly the ones server/mcp.py exposes to outside
agents: one list, one set of descriptions, one place to fix a mistake.

Three rules hold it together.

**Uploading is not something the model can do.** `publish_plan_execute` is
never offered here. The model may build a plan; turning that into uploads takes
a person pressing a button. Thirty videos cannot be un-uploaded, so the
confirmation is structural rather than a matter of the model behaving.

**It needs a model that can call tools.** Gemma 4 can; the app's default
gemma3:4b cannot, and neither can gemma:7b. Ollama reports this per model, so
the box says which model it is using and says plainly when none can, instead of
producing a confident answer having called nothing.

**Nothing here does the work itself.** Every step is a call to the local API,
the same one the window uses. The model decides what to call and in what order;
the engine still processes video, renders clips and talks to YouTube.
"""

# second half and said nothing, which is worse than either doing it or
# refusing. Colin's call, 2026-09-22: "it should do what i told it to do."
#
# What stands in for the gate: the model calls publish_plan before it
# executes, so there is a record of the intent, and a deferred publish only
# runs when the request actually asked for one (see `then` in server/jobs.py).
