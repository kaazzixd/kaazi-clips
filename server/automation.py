"""Watched channels: a creator posts, Kaazi Clips clips it, nobody pastes a link.

This is orchestration only. Detection is sources/channel_feed.py, processing is
the ordinary queue and worker, and publishing is woopsocial_service. What lives
here is the part that joins them without a person in between: noticing a new
video once, waiting until it can be downloaded, queueing it once, and deciding
what happens to its clips.

Built the way server/integrations.py is. Only the detection facts and the
publish decision are stored; once a video has a job, the job row and
clip_publishes are the truth about it, read live, so there is no second copy of
state to drift.

Off unless switched on. Nothing in this app starts processing on its own
(core/queue.is_paused), so turning automation on, and each watch, is the
standing go-ahead for exactly those videos and no others.

Supported API, documented in docs/API.md.
