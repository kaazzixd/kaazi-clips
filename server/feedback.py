"""Feedback Hub backend: diagnostics collection, redaction, and submission.

Reports are for NON-TECHNICAL users: they answer a few plain questions in
the UI, and this module contributes everything a developer needs to
reproduce the problem — versions, hardware, the exact AI model (name,
parameter size, quantization), settings, and the recent log tail. The
finished Markdown goes to the feedback relay (a Cloudflare Worker holding
the GitHub token — see feedback-relay/README.md), which files it as a
GitHub Issue. No GitHub account, no telemetry: nothing is ever sent unless
the user presses Submit, and the exact payload is previewable in the UI.

Diagnostics are built from an ALLOWLIST of known-safe fields — we never
dump raw config or environment. Free text and the log excerpt additionally
pass through redact(), which scrubs token-shaped strings and usernames in
Windows paths.
