"""Single background worker processing the SQLite job queue.

One worker, sequential jobs: video processing saturates the GPU/CPU anyway,
so parallel jobs on consumer hardware only make everything slower. The queue
lives in SQLite, so it survives restarts; jobs left 'running' by a crash are
re-queued at startup, and the pipeline resumes from its last completed stage.

Job types:
  process - {"url": ...}                       full pipeline for one video
  render  - {"clip_id", "start"?, "end"?}      re-render one clip (edited
                                               timestamps and/or captions)
