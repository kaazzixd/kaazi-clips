"""An MCP server for Kaazi Clips, spoken over stdio.

Lets Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any MCP client drive the engine in plain
language: queue a stream, watch the job, read back the clips it chose, export
one. It is a translation layer over the local HTTP API documented in
docs/API.md, which is the same API the desktop app and the OBS plugin use.

Two deliberate choices.

**No dependency.** MCP's stdio transport is newline-delimited JSON-RPC, which
the standard library already does. requirements.txt is a pinned list where
every line has a reason, and an SDK would also mean a new hidden import in
clips-studio.spec and a re-frozen backend, all for about 150 lines of
protocol. So this imports nothing that is not in Python.

**No second engine.** Every tool asks the running engine over
127.0.0.1:8765 rather than importing the pipeline. An agent that imported it
would start renders in a process with no queue, no database discipline and no
window showing the user what is happening.

Run it:

    python main.py mcp                 # from a source checkout
    api.exe mcp                        # inside an installed build

The engine has to be running: open Kaazi Clips, or `python main.py serve`.
