"""The thread that uploads finished clips to YouTube.

Deliberately NOT the pipeline worker, for three reasons that each on their own
would be enough:

* An upload is minutes of network I/O. Behind an hour of GPU work, "Upload now"
  is a lie; in front of it, one person's slow upstream stalls an overnight
  batch.
* The pipeline worker claims nothing while the queue is paused (core/queue.py),
  and paused is its DEFAULT state. An upload queued there would simply never
  start, with no visible reason.
* `recover_interrupted_jobs()` re-queues every running job on startup. For a
  video that resumes a stage. For an upload it would post the same video to
  someone's channel twice.

That last one is why publish jobs live in their own table with the opposite
recovery rule: a publish caught by a crash becomes 'interrupted' and stops
there, and the user is told to check their channel rather than have the app
guess.
