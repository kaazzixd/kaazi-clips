"""HTTP routes for publishing to several platforms through Upload-Post.

Structured like server/youtube_api.py and installed the same way, with one
call from create_app(). The same two rules hold:

* When the feature is switched off, every route here 404s and /uploadpost/status
  answers `{"enabled": false}` and nothing else. A disabled feature should look
  absent, not refused — an install that never touches Upload-Post makes no
  network calls to it and shows no trace of it.
* **The API key never leaves the backend.** No route returns it, echoes it back
  after saving, or puts it in an error. The UI is told `has_key` and the last
  four characters, which is enough to answer "which key is this?" and useless
  to anyone who reads it over a shoulder. Errors go through redact().
