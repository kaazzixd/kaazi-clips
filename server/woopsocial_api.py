"""HTTP routes for publishing through WoopSocial.

Mirrors server/uploadpost_api.py: same route shapes, same rules, same
`clip_publishes` table underneath, so the renderer talks to whichever
provider is switched on without caring which it is. Installed with one call
from create_app().

The two rules that hold everywhere here:

* A switched-off feature 404s and /woopsocial/status says only
  `{"enabled": false}`. Off should read as absent.
* **The API key never leaves the backend.** The UI gets `has_key` and four
  characters. Errors go through redact().
