    (server/automation.py). A second copy of this loop would drift from the

    One post per clip, because each clip is different media. The spacing uses
    WoopSocial's own scheduler rather than a timer here, so a run stretching
    over days keeps going with Kaazi Clips closed.

    `once` is for callers nobody is watching, which may run this again for the
    same clips after a restart or to retry failures. WoopSocial has no
    idempotency key, so the guard is here: a clip already sent or on its way to
    a platform is left alone, and each send is recorded as "sending" before any
    request goes out, then tagged with its media the moment the upload lands,
    so reconcile_sending can settle it if Kaazi Clips stops halfway. Without
    `once` nothing changes: a person pressing Publish again means it.

    `footer` goes under the standing text. `remember` keeps a background run
    from changing the platforms the publish dialog offers next time.

    `lead_hashtags` are a creator's own, set once ("#creatorname #twitch"):
    they open the hashtag line, so a platform that trims the end never loses
    them. `ai_hashtags=False` leaves out the ones the model chose. `day_start`

    A row still at "sending" long after any send could have finished means the
    app stopped between writing it and learning the result. Either the post
    was never created, and the clip can safely be sent again, or it was, and
    sending again would post it twice. The uploaded media tells which: no media
    means no post could exist, and a post carrying the media is adopted with
    its id, so the ordinary status refresh follows it from there.
