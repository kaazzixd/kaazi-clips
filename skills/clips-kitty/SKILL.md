# Clips Kitty

Clips Kitty finds the moments worth posting in a long video, crops them to 9:16 with the
speaker kept in frame, burns in captions and writes titles. Everything runs on the user's
own machine: no account, no upload, no API key.

## Connecting

The tools come from Clips Kitty's MCP server, which talks to the engine on
`127.0.0.1:8765`.

```bash
claude mcp add clips-kitty -- python main.py mcp     # from a source checkout
```

In an installed build the engine's binary is `api.exe`, inside the app's `resources\backend`
folder, so the command is `api.exe mcp`.

**Clips Kitty has to be running**, either the app itself or `python main.py serve`. If a
tool reports the engine is not answering, say so and stop: starting it is the user's call,
not something to work around.

## How to work

1. **Queue** with `queue_video` (a link) or `queue_local_file` (a file on disk).
2. **Check back** with `job_status`. Processing a two-hour stream takes tens of minutes on
   a good machine. Never sit in a polling loop: report the job id, and check when the user
   next asks or after a long wait.
3. **Read the results** with `list_clips`, which gives each clip's id, score and title.
4. **Export** with `export_clip` when the user names a folder.

## Things that will otherwise catch you out

- **A queued job is not guaranteed.** `queue_video` returns "Not queued" when that video
  was processed before, because redoing it costs an hour and duplicates its clips. Offer
  `list_clips` on the existing video, or `force` if they really meant it.
- **An unknown video id looks like a video with no clips**, because the API returns an
  empty list either way. Check `list_videos` before concluding a video produced nothing.
- **A paused queue looks like a broken app.** `queue_status` reports it. Check it before
  telling anyone nothing is happening.
- **Scores are the model's ranking, 0-100**, not a promise. The user picks what to post.
- **It is tuned for IRL, talking-head, podcast and gym footage.** Gaming, split-screen and
  reaction videos produce clips but frame them poorly. Say so rather than letting someone
  process a three-hour gaming VOD expecting good crops.

## What it will not do

There is no cloud tier, no upload of the user's footage anywhere, and no posting to social
platforms except YouTube, which the user switches on themselves with their own Google key.
Do not offer those.
