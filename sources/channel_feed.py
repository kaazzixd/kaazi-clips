"""What a watched channel has posted, on each platform that can say.

Detection only. This answers "a new video appeared, and here is its link"; the
link then goes through the same queue a pasted one does, so from there on a
watched video and a pasted one are the same thing. Nothing is downloaded here.

Per platform:
  YouTube  the channel's RSS feed (sources/youtube.py): free, unauthenticated,
           no quota. It has been returning errors and empty bodies on and off
           in 2026, so an empty or failed feed falls back to the channel's
           uploads playlist through yt-dlp, which lists the same videos.
  Twitch   the channel's past broadcasts, newest first, through yt-dlp. First
           page only: paging with cursors trips Twitch's integrity check.
  Kick     Kick's own channel videos endpoint. yt-dlp has no extractor that
           lists a Kick channel. The endpoint is unofficial, but it is the same
           API, behind the same Cloudflare impersonation, that downloading a
           Kick VOD already depends on; if it stops answering, Kick downloads
           have most likely stopped too, and the watch says so.

Every function that touches the network takes it as an argument, so tests
never do.
