"""Kick VOD source — VODs ONLY, by design (same policy as Twitch).

Live channel pages are rejected before any network call: processing a live
stream means an open-ended real-time capture, which the pipeline deliberately
does not do. Wait for the VOD on the channel's Videos tab and paste that link.

Kick VOD links look like  kick.com/video/<uuid>  (also accepted:
kick.com/<channel>/videos/<uuid>). Ids are stored prefixed as `kick_<uuid>`
so they can never collide with YouTube or Twitch ids anywhere in the app.
