"""Frames of a video BEFORE it is processed, for setting up a Gaming / Reaction
split on the real picture (the Generate bar's split setup, like the layout
step StreamLadder shows before processing).

Nothing is downloaded. A link is asked once for its media URL (yt-dlp, no
download, a 720p-or-smaller video stream) and FFmpeg seeks straight to the
moment wanted, reading only what that frame needs; a file on this computer is
read in place. Only links to the platforms Kaazi Clips clips from are
accepted, so this can't be pointed at anything else on the network.

YouTube's media URLs are tied to the IPv4 address that asked for them, and
FFmpeg (which has no "IPv4 only" switch) tries IPv6 first: on a network with
a broken IPv6 route that read hung for the full timeout, where the same byte
range over IPv4 took half a second. So YouTube is read through _Relay, a
loopback-only relay that forwards FFmpeg's range requests over IPv4.
