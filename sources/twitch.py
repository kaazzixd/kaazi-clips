"""Twitch VOD source — VODs ONLY, by design.

Live streams are deliberately rejected: processing a live channel means
capturing it in real time for however long the stream runs — open-ended,
heavy compute with no known duration, and pulling a stream while it airs
can even degrade the broadcast. A VOD is a finished file with a known
length, which is what the pipeline is built around. Wait for the VOD.

Twitch video ids are numeric; they're stored prefixed as `tw_<id>` so they
can never collide with YouTube's 11-character ids anywhere in the app
(state DB, downloads folder, clips folders).
