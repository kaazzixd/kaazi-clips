"""Cancel has to land while a stage is running, not after it finishes.

Cancellation is cooperative: the API sets a flag and the pipeline unwinds at
the next check. That only works if something checks *often enough*. It did
not. The checks sat at stage boundaries, so pressing Cancel during the two
slowest stages did nothing until they completed on their own:

  * transcription — one call over the whole video, many minutes
  * scoring — one LLM call per chunk, and a 12b model makes each one long

The app showed "cancelling" and kept working for hours. Reported against a
2-hour video on gemma3:12b with 152 minutes remaining.

Neither `transcribe()` nor `find_clips()` receives a video id — one takes a
path, the other a list of segments — so the fix is `cancel.check_active()`,
which asks about the video the worker is processing right now.
