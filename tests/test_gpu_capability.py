"""A GPU that CUDA can see is not the same as a GPU this build can run on.

`torch.cuda.is_available()` answers "is there a driver and a device". It says
nothing about whether the wheel was compiled for that device, and the gap
between those two questions is issue #83: an RTX 5070 Ti (Blackwell, sm_120)
against a CUDA 12.6 build topping out at sm_90 passed every check, accepted
`.to("cuda")`, and then killed the job at the first inference with "no kernel
image is available for execution on the device".

The cases below are the ones that actually matter, and two of them are traps:

  * an RTX 4090 is sm_89 while the newest Ada entry a wheel ships is sm_86, so
    testing for an exact match would silently demote every 4090 to CPU
  * sm_120 must parse as major 12, not major 1 or 120, or Blackwell compares
    against the wrong architectures entirely

There is no wheel that covers every card, so this is permanent: CUDA 13 buys
Blackwell and gives up Maxwell, Pascal and Volta. Whatever ships, somebody is
outside it, and they must land on the CPU with an explanation instead of a
crash.
