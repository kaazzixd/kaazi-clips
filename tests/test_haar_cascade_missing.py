"""A missing Haar cascade must cost crop precision, not the whole clip.

Issue #86: a job downloaded, transcribed, analysed, scored and picked a clip,
then rendered zero clips. The log ended with

    Render failed for 21s-39s: OpenCV(4.13.0) cascadedetect.cpp:1689:
      error: (-215:Assertion failed) !empty() in function 'detectMultiScale'

`cv2.CascadeClassifier` given a path that does not exist does NOT raise. It
returns an empty classifier, and the failure only appears later inside
`detectMultiScale`. So a missing data file surfaced as a rendering crash.

It was missing because the frozen build ships cv2 as a hidden import, which
carries the module and not its data directory — meaning this reproduced only in
installed copies and never from a checkout, which is why it shipped.

Two defences, both tested here: the file is now resolved through core.binaries
(so the bundled copy is found), and an unusable cascade disables face
refinement instead of raising.
