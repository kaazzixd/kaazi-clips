"""Values that arrive as data must not be able to escape their folder.

CodeQL raised 50 alerts against this repo; these cover the ones that were
genuinely reachable rather than the ones that describe the app working as
intended (a creator picking any video to import and any folder to export to
is the product, not a vulnerability).

Two shapes of real bug, both from stored configuration rather than a file
dialog:

  * `image_asset` inside a saved branding profile was joined straight onto
    the assets folder and handed to FFmpeg as an input path.
  * `voice_id` from the API became both `voices_dir / f"{name}.onnx"` and
    the `-m` argument of a piper subprocess. A leading "-" there is not
    traversal — it turns a filename into a flag.
