"""A deleted Kick VOD is a normal event, not a failure.

Kick removes VODs after a retention window. The link keeps its shape, the
channel stays up, and one day the video is simply gone — so this is something
users hit routinely rather than an outage.

Issue #87 reported it as "Kick is broken", and the raw error supported that
reading: "HTTP Error 404: Unable to download JSON metadata". It was not broken.
Checked at the time: the channel's API answered 200 and listed five current
VODs, the reported id was not among them, and another VOD from that same
channel downloaded at 1080p60 through the same yt-dlp and the same extractor.

So the tooling was fine and the message was the bug — the same shape as the raw
YouTube 403 in #81 and the discarded FFmpeg error in #84.
