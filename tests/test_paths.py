"""Where an install keeps a creator's videos.

`data_dir` ships as the relative path "data" and used to be resolved against
the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY. In a checkout that quietly meant "wherever you
ran python from". In an installed copy it was worse: Electron spawns the
engine without setting a working directory, so downloads, clips and the
database could land inside Program Files, which is not writable without
admin — the first download would simply fail.
