"""A failed render has to say why, and a report has to say which build.

Issue #84 arrived as "all 10 clips failed to cut" with no FFmpeg error and no
app version. Both were our own bugs, and together they made a critical report
undiagnosable:

  * `_render_failure_reason` took the FIRST line of the exception. For a cut
    failure that line is `video/cutter.py`'s own "ffmpeg cut failed:" prefix,
    so the 2000 characters of stderr underneath were captured and thrown away
    one line later.
  * `_app_version` read `ui/package.json` next to the source. In a frozen
    build that path is inside the executable and does not exist, so every
    installed copy reported `"app": "?"` and no report could be dated.

The third test covers the fix that makes the failure survivable rather than
merely legible: a GPU encoder that passes its synthetic probe can still refuse
real footage, and retrying on the CPU turns an empty job into a slow one.
