"""Issue #74, as tests.

Ten of thirteen clips failed with `[WinError 32] The process cannot access
the file because it is being used by another process`. The reporter had a
strong machine and had correctly ruled out antivirus.

Nothing was wrong with their PC. `compute_tracking` opened a
`cv2.VideoCapture` and released it 160 lines later with no `try/finally`, so
an exception in between leaked the handle. On Windows an open handle blocks
deletion, so the pipeline's scratch cleanup then raised — and because that
cleanup ran inside a `finally`, the PermissionError REPLACED the exception
already in flight. The real error was destroyed for every affected clip, and
the caller discards a clip on any exception, so clips already written to disk
were thrown away as well.

Two behaviours are pinned here, plus two scans so the shape cannot come back.
