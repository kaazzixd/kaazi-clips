"""The decision logic around TalkNet, tested without TalkNet.

The model itself needs a GPU, a 63 MB checkpoint and real footage, none of
which belong in a unit test. What IS worth pinning down is everything around
it, because every one of these was got wrong first:

  * scoring only where two people are actually on screen — the optimisation
    that keeps this affordable
  * refusing to answer during silence, which is what replaced a broken
    absolute threshold on the model's logit
  * treating "this person was not on screen" as no answer rather than as a
    quiet answer

pytest.importorskip because CI installs four packages and none of them is
OpenCV; this runs locally and on any machine with the full requirements.
