"""The web tool must score with the SAME prompt the desktop app ships.

`web/` is a static bundle with no server, so it cannot read
`config/prompts/` at runtime — the scoring prompt is embedded in
`web/lib/score.ts` as a template literal instead.

That duplication is the point of this test. The web page exists to show a
stranger what Kaazi Clips's judgement is like before they download it. If the
prompt improves here and the copy over there silently stays behind, the demo
starts advertising a product that no longer exists, and nothing fails — the
page keeps working, just worse than the thing it is selling. Nobody would
notice for months.

If this test fails, copy `config/prompts/score_clips.txt` into the
`SCORE_PROMPT` literal in `web/lib/score.ts`. Do not "fix" it by editing the
prompt file to match the web copy.
