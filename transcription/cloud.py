"""Transcription online, on the user's own API key.

Local Whisper (transcription/transcriber.py) is the default and this does not
touch it. This is the opt-in for a PC too slow to transcribe long videos: the
audio is sent, in chunks, to the provider the user chose, with their key.

The result has to be indistinguishable from a local transcript to everything
downstream, so it is written to the same cache file in the same shape:
{"video_id", "language", "segments": [{"start", "end", "text", "words"}]},
with words as {"start", "end", "word"} and punctuation on the words, in
absolute seconds from the start of the video. Captions, filler cuts, the
editor's word tools, sentence snapping and translation all read that.

Only providers that return word timings are offered: without them captions
would drift and word editing would vanish. A part where nothing is said (a
stream's music-only intro: measured, 10 minutes of one) has no words and
that's fine; a part with text but no word timings is the model's limit.

Whisper makes words up where nobody speaks: "Thank you." 640 times in one
two-hour stream, "谢谢大家" and the like, one in every quiet stretch. Local
Whisper never shows them because faster-whisper runs a voice detector
(Silero) first. The same detector runs here, on each part before it is
sent: a part where nobody speaks isn't sent at all (and isn't paid for),
and a word the model returns outside the speech it found is dropped.
Nothing falls back to local Whisper; a failing provider fails the job, in
plain words.
