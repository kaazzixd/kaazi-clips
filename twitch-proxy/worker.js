/**
 * Clips Kitty Twitch proxy — the one piece of server the web version needs.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * Twitch VODs cannot be read from a browser. `gql.twitch.tv` is fine, but
 * `usher.ttvnw.net` sends NO CORS headers on a successful response, and
 * neither does the CloudFront CDN behind it — not for manifests, not for the
 * `.ts` segments. The browser therefore refuses to hand any of it to the page.
 *
 * > The trap, recorded because it already caught us once: Twitch DOES send
 * > `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on ERROR responses. A made-up VOD id
 * > 403s with permissive headers and looks like proof the path is open. Test
 * > CORS against a SUCCESSFUL response, or the errors will lie to you.
 *
 * So the bytes have to come through something that adds the header. This is
 * that something, and nothing more: it does not transcode, cache, or store.
 *
 * ## Why Cloudflare and not Vercel
 *
 * Cloudflare does not bill egress for Workers. A two-hour VOD is ~190 MB of
 * audio, which would consume Vercel's entire monthly allowance in ~500 runs;
 * here the bytes are free and only the REQUEST COUNT is metered. The free
 * plan's 100,000 requests/day is roughly 130 VODs — see README.md.
 *
 * ## Shape, and why it is not a generic `?url=` proxy
 *
 * A generic proxy is an open relay: anyone who finds the URL gets free
 * bandwidth on someone else's account. Instead this exposes three narrow
 * endpoints and REWRITES the playlists so every URL a client follows points
 * back here rather than at Twitch:
 *
 *   GET /master?vod=<id>  token + usher, rendition URLs rewritten to /media
 *   GET /media?u=<url>    a rendition playlist, segment names rewritten to /seg
 *   GET /seg?u=<url>      one segment, streamed straight through
 *   GET /health[?vod=]    walks all four steps and reports each
 *
 * Requests are further limited to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and to Twitch-owned
 * hostnames. See the README for the HMAC upgrade if that stops being enough.
 *
 * ## Free-plan constraints this is built around
 *
 * 50 subrequests per invocation, so the worker never fetches-and-stitches a
 * whole VOD — the browser pulls each segment through separately, one upstream
 * fetch per request. Streaming means CPU stays near zero regardless of size:
 * the response body is handed straight back without being buffered.

/** Hostnames this will fetch from. Everything else is refused, so the worker
 *  cannot be pointed at arbitrary targets even by a forged request.
 *
 *  `.cloudfront.net` is broader than ideal — it is anyone's CloudFront, not

 *  distributions with no stable pattern to match on. The origin check below
 *  is what carries the weight; this is the second lock, not the first. */

/** Which pages may use this.
 *
 *  Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS in wrangler.toml. A browser cannot forge `Origin`, so
 *  this stops the obvious abuse — somebody else's web page quietly spending
 *  this worker's daily request budget. It does NOT stop a determined person
 *  with curl, which is a deliberate trade: the alternative is signing every
 *  URL, which costs a secret and a setup step for a tool whose whole point is
 *  being free and easy to run. Upgrade if it is ever actually abused. */
/** Does `origin` match one allowlist entry, which may contain `*`?
 *
 *  Wildcards exist because Vercel mints a NEW HOSTNAME FOR EVERY DEPLOYMENT —
 *  previews, and the per-deployment URL sitting behind the production alias.
 *  A literal list is therefore correct for exactly as long as it takes to push
 *  again, which is how this spent several rounds failing with the same error.
 *
 *  `*` becomes `[^.]*` rather than `.*`, on purpose. `.*` would let
 *  `https://clips-kitty-web-*.vercel.app` match
 *  `https://evil.clips-kitty-web-x.vercel.app` — a domain anybody can create,
