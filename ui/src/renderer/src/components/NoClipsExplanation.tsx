/** Why a finished run produced no clips.
 *
 *  This replaces "No clips for this video yet", which reads like a fault and
 *  sends people straight to the bug reporter. The commonest cause by far is
 *  footage the scoring was never meant for — gameplay, or anything with nobody
 *  on screen — and the run knows that: part of a clip's score measures whether
 *  a person is visible, so those score zero on that term rather than merely low.
 *
 *  The tone matters as much as the facts. Someone reading this has just spent
 *  twenty minutes on a video and got nothing back; it has to explain without
 *  reading as "you picked the wrong video".
