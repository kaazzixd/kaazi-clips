/** Lets the interface run in a plain browser, for contributors.
 *
 *  `window.studio` is injected by Electron's preload. Open the Vite dev
 *  server directly — which is what the Docker `ui` service serves — and it
 *  does not exist, so the first click on anything native throws.
 *
 *  This installs a stand-in that says what it cannot do instead of failing
 *  silently. Everything that matters for interface work still functions,
 *  because that all goes over HTTP to the engine, not through Electron.
 *
 *  Never active under Electron: the real preload sets window.studio before
 *  any of this runs, and it is left strictly alone.
