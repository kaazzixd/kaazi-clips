"""Active speaker detection: who, out of the faces on screen, is talking.

Mouth-region pixel motion cannot answer this. It measures MOVEMENT, and two
people in a lively room move about equally — measured on a real two-person
clip the speaker and the listener scored 0.0746 and 0.0801, a 7% difference,
while their on-screen sizes differed by 45%. Anything built on that signal
ends up following whoever is bigger.

TalkNet-ASD answers it properly: a network trained on labelled footage to
judge whether a face's mouth movement matches the sound. It is the same class
of model the commercial clipping tools use.

Everything here runs locally. The weights ship with the app the same way the
YOLO weights do (see clips-studio.spec) — nothing is fetched at runtime.

COST, measured on a 60s clip on an RTX 3060, because the obvious way to feed
this model is five times slower than the careful way and that is not evident
from reading it:

    tracking as it stands (8fps)              62.3s
    TalkNet forward pass, two people           1.2s   <- not the expensive part
    frame reads + crops, reusing 8fps boxes     8.4s   -> +15% overall
    re-detecting with YOLO at 25fps          280.2s   -> +452% overall

The model is nearly free. The cost is entirely in getting frames to it, and
the trap is that TalkNet wants 25fps while the tracker samples at 8. Running
the detector again at 25fps to satisfy that makes every job five times
slower; interpolating the boxes already computed at 8fps and reading frames
between them costs 15%. Do not "simplify" this by detecting at 25fps.

At 15% it can run on everything rather than behind a "does this look like two
people talking?" test — which would be a heuristic guarding the very question
the model exists to answer, and would fall back silently to the mouth-motion
path when it guessed wrong. The one worthwhile skip is not a judgement at
all: with fewer than two faces on screen there is nobody to choose between.

The model itself is vendored, unmodified, under third_party/talknet/ (MIT,
(c) 2021 Tao Ruijie). This module is the adapter: it owns loading, the input
format, and a single scoring call, so the vendored files stay exactly as
published and can be re-fetched or upgraded without untangling our changes
from theirs.
