"""Vertical 9:16 rendering from a tracking result.

Three modes (see video/tracker.py for how they're chosen):

  track    - OpenCV follows the smoothed crop path frame by frame, then FFmpeg
             scales to 1080x1920, burns captions, and muxes the audio back in.
  split    - gameplay + facecam layout: webcam region stacked on top (35%),
             centered gameplay crop below (65%). Both regions static, so this
             renders in ONE pure-FFmpeg pass with no per-frame Python.
  fit_blur - subjects too spread out to crop without cutting someone off: show
             the full width fit into 1080 wide, centered, with the empty top
             and bottom filled by a blurred, zoomed copy of the video.

No-stretch guarantee in every mode: content keeps its aspect ratio and only
ever gets uniformly scaled — distortion is impossible by construction.
