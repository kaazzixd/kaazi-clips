"""Hardware-accelerated encoding selection — NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.

Hardware encoders render H.264 many times faster than libx264 on CPU and
leave the CPU free for detection/analysis. Preference order:

  NVENC (NVIDIA) -> AMF (AMD) -> QSV (Intel) -> libx264 (CPU)

Detection is done once per process by actually test-encoding a frame WITH
THE EXACT ARGUMENTS we render with — an encoder can be listed by FFmpeg but
still fail at runtime (missing hardware, driver/session limits, unsupported
flags on older drivers). A failed probe just means the next candidate is
tried, so a wrong flag on some AMD driver degrades to CPU encoding instead
of breaking renders.

Config: video.encoder in settings.yaml — "auto" (default) or force one of
"nvenc" / "amf" / "qsv" / "cpu".

    `select` does the subsampling inside FFmpeg, so the frames that are
