"""Shared framing components — the parts of the Podcast rebuild that are not
podcast-specific, factored out so every pipeline can use them.

The Podcast pipeline was rebuilt around three ideas that turned out to be
general truths about framing footage, not facts about podcasts:

  1. CUTS ARE BOUNDARIES. When the source hard-cuts to another camera, the
     old framing is meaningless. Panning across a cut is always wrong: the
     crop should snap, and per-subject state built up before the cut (mouth
     motion in particular) must be thrown away, not carried over.

  2. COMMIT TO ONE SUBJECT. Averaging two people's positions frames neither
     of them — it just parks the crop between two faces. Pick the person who
     is talking, else the most prominent, and put them in frame.

  3. HOLD, THEN MOVE DELIBERATELY. A camera that corrects every small error
     never settles; the constant micro-adjustment reads as drift and jitter.
     A held frame that moves only on real, sustained drift — and then moves
     decisively and stops — reads as intentional.

Point 1 and 2 are shared as plain functions; point 3 is the HoldMove
controller. Each pipeline still decides its own policy — the podcast path
freezes one crop per shot, the stream path pans continuously — but they now
share the primitives instead of each growing their own copy.
