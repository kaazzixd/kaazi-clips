"""Draw the Kaazi Clips mascot. THIS MODULE IS THE SOURCE OF THE ARTWORK.

A cat-monkey. Cat's head and ears; monkey's heart-shaped face patch, long
curling tail and little grabby hands. Dark navy fur from the dashboard
background, sky blue from the dashboard accent on the face, belly and paws.

It used to live in `scripts/make_mascot.py`, which is still the command that
writes the PNGs and the icon:

    python scripts/make_mascot.py

It moved here because `scripts/` is not packaged into the frozen build, and
`video/outro.py` needs this geometry at runtime to animate Clippy. Editing the
numbers below still changes the mascot everywhere; re-run that command to
regenerate the files.

Drawn for plush and print, which is a real constraint on the shapes:
  * chibi proportions — head about as wide as the body, which is what makes
    a character read as cute rather than merely animal-shaped;
  * big eyes set low and wide apart, with two highlights each;
  * every silhouette is a circle or a rounded blob, because sharp angles
    are what make a sewn version look wrong;
  * few parts, flat colour, no gradients — a pattern-cutter can follow it
    and it survives being embroidered small.
Everything is drawn at 4x and downsampled: Pillow's shapes are aliased, and
jagged edges make a mascot look broken at any size.
