"""The branded end card appended to every clip.

Clip ends -> Clippy pounces on a ball of yarn -> "Kaazi Clips" lands ->
"Made with" / "Free & Open Source" -> hard cut. 2.9 seconds.

This is organic marketing: a clip in someone's feed is the only distribution
the app gets for free, so a viewer should be able to see what made it. ON by
default, because a feature nobody enables markets nothing.

Everything about the animation lives in this one file, so it can be redrawn
later without the pipeline knowing. The pipeline's entire interface is
`append(clip, config)`.

Three things are worth knowing before changing anything here:

**Clippy is not redrawn.** `video/mascot_art.py` IS the mascot — the same
geometry that writes docs/brand/mascot.png. This module calls those functions
into separate layers and poses the layers, so the ears, whiskers, belly and
tail are the real ones. `verify()` composes the rest pose and diffs it against
the shipped PNG; it must stay at zero.

**The clip is never re-encoded.** The outro is generated to match the clip's
exact width, height, fps, pixel format and audio parameters, then appended
with the concat demuxer and `-c copy`. That match is what makes the append
free and lossless — and it is why the cache is keyed on all of it.

**It is built once per format, not once per video.** Prebuilt cards ship
for every format the pipeline actually emits -- both canvases at 30 and
60fps -- so in practice nothing is ever rendered on a user's machine.
Anything unusual renders once, in about 20 seconds, and is then cached.

    PRODUCES the file. CapCut works the same way -- the outro is part of the

    It matters because of a measured asymmetry on Windows. With a clip held the
    way the desktop app holds it while previewing (read access, sharing read

    version replaced, so a clip open in the UI lost its card no matter how long
    we waited -- one run managed only 37 of 49, and spent twelve minutes
    stalling on locks it could never win. Producing the file cannot hit that
    operation at all.
