"""Podcast clips — a separate, opt-in path for multi-cam, multi-person footage.

v3, rebuilt after v2 failed on real podcast footage, then refined (v4) so
each shot punches in on ONE person instead of averaging two toward the
middle. v2 made one decision for the whole clip, but a podcast is a sequence
of SHOTS: it hard-cuts between camera angles, and every angle shows people at
different positions and sizes. Deciding globally meant the same person
counted as two "speakers" (one track per angle — v2 split-screened a guy
with himself), letterbox regions mixed positions from different shots
(quarter-faces), and smoothing panned across cuts hunting for the face.

So this works the way the podcast itself is edited — SHOT BY SHOT:

  1. Camera cuts are detected first (frame differencing).
  2. Within each shot, the framing is ONE static crop — podcast guests sit
     still, so a fixed face-centered crop is rock steady and is on the face
     from the shot's first frame. No drifting onto faces after a cut.
  3. The crop punches in TIGHT on ONE person — whoever is talking in that
     shot (mouth motion), falling back to the most prominent person when
     nobody clearly talks. It centers on that person's FACE positions only
     (never a body-center guess, never an average of two people), so the
     face lands in frame instead of the crop hovering near the middle.
  4. At each cut the crop SNAPS to the new shot's framing. Nothing pans.

Why one person, not two: earlier versions averaged two nearby people into a
single wide crop, which pulled every shot back toward center and showed both
faces small — the "everyone tiny" look. A podcast is cut so that when the
other person speaks, the camera cuts to them; so the right move per shot is
to frame the one who matters and let the edit's own cuts handle the rest.

No split screens and no automatic letterbox — both produced bad results on
real footage. The editor's manual Layout override (Center/Letterbox) still
works per clip.

Isolation: imported only when the Podcast toggle set the flag; reuses the
tracker's detection helpers read-only; video/tracker.py is never modified,
and with the toggle off normal clips run exactly the code they ran before.
