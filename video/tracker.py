"""YOLOv8 + OpenCV subject tracking (v2).

Input:  a clip video file.
Output: a tracking result dict the cropper renders from:

  {"mode": "track", "path": [(t, center_x), ...]}
      Follow-the-subject mode: a smoothed horizontal crop path
      (center_x normalized 0..1).

  {"mode": "split", "webcam_box": (x, y, w, h)}
      Gameplay + facecam layout detected (all values normalized 0..1):
      render the webcam region stacked on top of a centered gameplay crop.
      Both regions are static, so this mode cannot jitter at all.

v2 upgrades over v1:
  - Identity tracking: detections are chained into tracks by IoU, so the
    system follows *people*, not per-frame boxes.
  - Target hysteresis: the camera switches subjects only when a challenger
    clearly dominates for >= 1.5s — no ping-ponging mid-conversation.
  - Two-person framing: when exactly two subjects persist close together,
    the crop frames their midpoint.
  - Pan-speed clamp: the window can never move faster than max_pan_speed
    (fraction of frame width per second) — kills whip-pans on detector noise.
  - Facecam layout detection for gameplay streams.

v3 brings over what the Podcast rebuild proved out (see video/framing.py):
  - Hold-then-move: the crop parks and only moves on genuine sustained
    drift, instead of correcting every sample. The old chain oscillated
    inside a narrow band — many small reversals that read as the camera
    wandering and never committing to a face.
  - A trailing-median target, so one bad detection box cannot yank framing.
  - Commit to the speaker: two subjects share a midpoint crop only while
    NOBODY is talking; once someone speaks the crop frames them, because a
    midpoint between two faces frames neither.
  - Cut awareness: cuts are detected every frame; the crop snaps across
    them rather than panning, and mouth-motion state is dropped so the
    talking detector doesn't score everyone a speaker after a cut. Single
    continuous-camera footage never trips this and is unaffected.

v4 follows whoever is SPEAKING, and there is exactly one thing that decides
that: TalkNet (see video/asd.py). Mouth-region pixel movement is still
measured, but only as a prominence tiebreak — it is not a speaker detector
and must never be used as one again. It measures MOVEMENT, and two people in
a lively room move about equally, so it reliably picks whoever is BIGGER.

An earlier version kept it as a fallback for when TalkNet could not run. That
was a mistake: it meant the wrong behaviour could still happen silently, on
whichever clips took the other branch, with nothing in the output to say
which detector had decided. The weights ship with the app, so there was
nothing to fall back FOR. When TalkNet has no answer nobody is named and the
crop simply stays put, which is the honest thing to do when it is not known
who is talking.

Changing subject is a CUT, never a pan (_SWITCH_CUT). Which subject, and
when, is planned for the whole clip up front rather than decided sample by
sample — see _shot_plan for why an online decision was always late.

Fully decoupled from clip selection: this module knows nothing about
transcripts, scores, or uploads.
