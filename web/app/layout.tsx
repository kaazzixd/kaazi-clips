 *  Absolute rather than a local `/mascot.png` on purpose: relative metadata
 *  URLs need `metadataBase`, which means knowing the deployed domain at build
 *  time — and this app is meant to be deployable anywhere without config.
 *  The marketing site already serves this exact file for the same purpose
 *  (see the og:image in site/index.html), so it is one asset, one place. */

/** Written for the places this link actually gets pasted.
 *
 *  Without these tags a Discord, Reddit or X post renders the URL bare, which
 *  is a poor first impression for anything — and a fatal one for a page whose
 *  next request is "sign in with your OpenRouter account". A preview card is
 *  most of what makes a shared link look like a product rather than spam.
 *
 *  The description leads with what someone gets and closes on the two
 *  objections a creator has about a web tool they have never heard of: does
 *  it need an install, and where does my footage go. */
