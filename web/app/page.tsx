 *  anywhere cannot leak from anywhere, and that claim is only worth making if
 *  the architecture makes it structurally true rather than carefully
 *  observed. The same goes for the VOD: Twitch's and Kick's CDNs talk to the
 *  visitor's browser directly, so their footage never touches us either.
 *
 *  The flow is deliberately linear (choose a source → transcribe → score →
 *  cut) rather than a queue or a dashboard. This is a free taster used once
 *  by someone deciding whether to download the real thing; anything that
 *  needs managing belongs in the desktop app.
