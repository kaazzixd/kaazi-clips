/** Generates a static `robots.txt` at build time.
 *
 *  Mirrors the `robots` metadata in `layout.tsx` rather than duplicating the
 *  decision: both read `SITE_URL`, so there is one switch and no way for the
 *  meta tag and the robots file to disagree — which is the usual way a site
 *  ends up half-indexed.
 *
 *  While `SITE_URL` is empty this disallows everything, deliberately. See the
 *  note on that constant for why it was empty at first and when it was set.
 *
 *  `/callback` is always excluded. It exists for a few hundred milliseconds
 *  during an OAuth handshake, carries a single-use code in its query string,
 *  and has nothing to say to a reader.
