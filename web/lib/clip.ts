/** Cutting clips out of the visitor's own file, in their own tab.
 *
 *  ## Stream copy only
 *
 *  Every cut here is `-c copy`: the existing video and audio packets are
 *  remuxed into a new container without being decoded or re-encoded. That is
 *  the difference between a clip appearing in a second and a browser tab
 *  grinding for ten minutes, and it is why this page can exist on the kind of
 *  laptop it is aimed at.
 *
 *  The cost is frame accuracy. A copy cut can only start on a keyframe, so a
 *  clip may begin up to a second or two before the requested timestamp. That
 *  is the right trade for drafts someone is about to drop into an editor.
 *  **Do not "fix" this by re-encoding** — that is where browser video dies,
 *  and precise cuts, vertical reframing and burned captions are deliberately
 *  what the desktop app is for.
 *
 *  ## Why WORKERFS
 *
 *  ffmpeg.wasm normally wants its input written into an in-memory virtual
 *  filesystem, which for a 1 GB recording means a second full copy in RAM on
 *  top of the one the browser already holds — the fastest way to kill the
 *  tab. WORKERFS maps the `File` object itself and reads it lazily through
 *  the File API, so a long VOD costs almost nothing to mount.

 *
 *  ## Why these cannot be root-relative paths
 *
 *  `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` resolves `classWorkerURL` with
 *  `new Worker(new URL(path, import.meta.url))`. Turbopack replaces
 *  `import.meta.url` in the bundle with a module descriptor carrying a
 *  **file:// path from the machine that built it**, so `"/ffmpeg/worker.js"`
 *  resolved to `file:///ffmpeg/worker.js` and the browser refused it:
 *
 *      Failed to construct 'Worker': Script at 'file:///ffmpeg/worker.js'
 *      cannot be accessed from origin 'https://…'
 *
 *  An ABSOLUTE url makes `new URL(absolute, base)` ignore the base entirely,
 *  so whatever the bundler did to `import.meta.url` stops mattering. That is
 *  the whole fix — do not "tidy" these back into relative paths.
 *
 *  Resolved lazily rather than at module scope because this is a static
 *  export: module-level code runs during prerender, where `window` does not
