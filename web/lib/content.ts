/** The public address this tool lives at, and the single switch that turns

 *
 *  Set to the `*.vercel.app` address on 2026-10-03, on the maintainer's
 *  decision. It was left empty until then to wait for a real domain, because
 *  an address that collects ranking has to be retired when the site moves.
 *  No domain was coming, the marketing site lives on github.io for the same
 *  reason, and a page nobody can find demonstrates nothing. If a domain is
 *  ever pointed here, change this and have Vercel redirect the old address.
 *
 *  While it is empty the page asks not to be indexed. Setting it does three
 *  things at once: allows indexing, sets the canonical URL, and fills in the
 *  sitemap. No other file needs touching.
 *
 *  Prefer a subdomain or path of whatever domain the marketing site ends up
 *  on (`try.example.com`, or `example.com/try`) rather than a separate
 *  domain. Two domains split the link equity between the page that explains
 *  the product and the page that demonstrates it; one consolidates it.
 *
 *  Annotated `: string` deliberately. Without it TypeScript infers the
 *  literal type `""`, every `if (SITE_URL)` becomes provably false, and the
 *  branches that use it narrow to `never` — the compiler rejects code that is
 *  correct the moment a real value is filled in. */
