/** Reading an HLS VOD from the browser, whoever is serving it.
 *
 *  Twitch and Kick differ only in how you find the master playlist — one
 *  wants a signed GraphQL token, the other hands the URL over in a plain JSON
 *  response. Everything after that is the same standard HLS, so it lives here
 *  and `twitch.ts` / `kick.ts` are reduced to "give me a master playlist URL".
 *
 *  ## The two-rendition trick, which is what makes this possible at all
 *
 *  A long VOD is gigabytes of video and no browser tab will hold that. But
 *  transcription is the only stage that needs the *whole* recording, and it
 *  only needs the sound. So this picks two renditions:
 *
 *  * the **cheapest audible one** for transcription — an `audio_only` track
 *    where the platform offers one (Twitch), otherwise the lowest-bandwidth
 *    video rendition (Kick's 160p is ~230 kbps, about 100 MB an hour)
 *  * the **best video one** for cutting, of which only the few segments
 *    covering a chosen moment are ever fetched
 *
 *  That is the difference between this being a feature and being impossible.
