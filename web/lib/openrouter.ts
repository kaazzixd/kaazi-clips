/** Everything that talks to OpenRouter, from the visitor's browser only.
 *
 *  The rule this file exists to enforce: **no key ever reaches our server.**
 *  The visitor signs in with their own OpenRouter account, the key that comes
 *  back is theirs, it lives in their localStorage, and every request below is
 *  made by their browser directly to openrouter.ai. Nothing here runs on
 *  Vercel, so there is no server-side path a key could leak through.
 *
 *  That is not a stylistic choice. It is what lets this page exist at all:
 *  inference is billed to the visitor, so a free tool costs the project
 *  nothing, and a 2-hour VOD is ~24 sequential calls that would blow any
 *  serverless timeout but is merely a loop in a tab.
 *
 *  Two OpenRouter quirks worth knowing before editing:
 *
 *  1. `HTTP-Referer` is deliberately NOT the standard `Referer` header, which
 *     browsers forbid scripts from setting. OpenRouter picked a non-standard
 *     name precisely so browser apps can attribute themselves, and their CORS
 *     allow-list includes it. This is what creates our app page in their
 *     marketplace, and it counts traffic to us regardless of whose key paid.
 *  2. STT pricing is reported in DIFFERENT UNITS PER PROVIDER for the same
 *     model (Groq bills whisper-large-v3-turbo per hour, DeepInfra per
 *     second). Never compute a cost estimate by multiplying blindly.
