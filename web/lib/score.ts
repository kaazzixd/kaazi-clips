/** Finding the moments worth clipping — the same way the desktop app does.
 *
 *  This is a port of `analysis/highlights.py`, not a fresh take on the same
 *  idea. That matters: this page exists to show what Clips Kitty's judgement
 *  is like, so if it scored differently it would be advertising a product
 *  nobody can download. The prompt below is copied byte-for-byte from
 *  `config/prompts/score_clips.txt`, and the parser mirrors
 *  `_parse_clips_json` including which malformed cases it forgives.
 *
 *  KEEP IN SYNC. If the prompt changes in the main repo, change it here too.
 *  It is duplicated rather than fetched because this page is a static bundle
 *  with no server to read the repo from.
 *
 *  ## This is ONE STAGE of the desktop pipeline, not all of it
 *
 *  Worth being precise about, because it sets what this page can honestly
 *  claim. The desktop app's entry point is `analysis/fusion.py`, which calls
 *  `find_highlights()` — the part ported here — and then does considerably
 *  more with the result:
 *
 *  * a second LLM pass over signal-peak windows (`score_windows.txt`)
 *  * fused scoring across five weighted signals, of which this text pass is
 *    weighted **0.30**; the others are visual, reaction, audio and engagement
 *  * trending, action and creator-context bonuses
 *  * a rerank pass over the finalists (`rerank.txt`)
 *
 *  And outside fusion: creator intelligence (catchphrases, storylines,
 *  learned preferences) and Twitch chat-replay hype curves from
 *  `analysis/hype.py`.
 *
 *  What IS here: the text pass, the **audio channel** (`audioEvents.ts` — a
 *  port of `analysis/audio_features.py`, free because the PCM is already
 *  decoded for transcription), and the **weighted fusion** that makes it
 *  count (`fuse.ts`), including the trending bonus.
 *
 *  What is NOT here: the visual and reaction channels, which need video
 *  decode and an active-speaker model; the signal-peak window pass; the
 *  rerank pass; and any memory of the creator. So picks still differ from the
 *  desktop app's, most visibly on gameplay, where on-screen action carries
 *  weight that no amount of listening recovers.
 *
 *  One further difference, this one about cost rather than capability: there
 *  is **no separate metadata pass**. The desktop app makes extra calls for
 *  titles and descriptions; here the `hook` scoring already returns serves as
 *  the title, which costs nothing extra — worth it when a free OpenRouter
 *  account gets 50 requests a day.

/** Copied verbatim from config/prompts/score_clips.txt. */
const SCORE_PROMPT = `You are an expert short-form video editor. You find the moments in long videos that perform best as viral vertical Shorts/Reels/TikToks.

Below is a transcript with timestamps in seconds, formatted as:
[start - end] spoken text

You may also see an AUDIO/VISUAL EVENTS list from automated signal analysis (loud reactions, laughter, scene cuts, high motion). A mild-sounding transcript line that coincides with a big audio spike is often a GREAT clip — weigh the events seriously.{mode_guidance}

Find the best self-contained clip moments. Judge each candidate against this virality framework:
- Hook moments and strong opening lines
- Emotional peaks (laughter, anger, excitement, shock)
- Opinion-driven statements ("opinion bombs")
- Revelations or disclosures
- Conflict or tension
- Quotable lines
- Story-structure peaks (setup that pays off)
- Practical or actionable value
- TRENDING & DRAMA (weight this heavily): the speaker names or reacts to another creator, streamer, celebrity, influencer, or public figure; discusses beef, callouts, controversy, or drama; reacts to viral/trending content, current events, or something everyone is talking about. These moments ride existing attention and perform extremely well — score them high and set "trending": true.

Rules:
- Each clip must be {min_duration} to {max_duration} seconds long. Let the moment decide its own length within that range — a punchy one-liner might be 12 seconds, a story that builds to a payoff might be 45. Do NOT default to the shortest length; capture the whole self-contained moment including its setup and payoff.
- Each clip must make sense on its own with no extra context.
- start and end must be numbers in seconds taken from the transcript timestamps.
- score is 0-100 predicted viral potential. Be critical: most moments score below 50. Only truly strong moments score above 80.
- engagement is 0-100 for hook strength + payoff + quotability specifically: would someone stop scrolling in the first 2 seconds, and is there a satisfying payoff?
- trending is true if this moment names/reacts to another creator, celebrity, or public figure, or discusses drama/beef/controversy/trending topics; otherwise false. When true, boost the score.
- Return at most 5 clips. If nothing is good, return an empty list.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in exactly this shape, no other text:
{"clips": [{"start": 124.5, "end": 162.0, "score": 87, "engagement": 80, "trending": true, "hook": "...", "reason": "..."}]}

Field meanings:
- "hook": an attention-grabbing one-liner about THIS moment. It MUST be built from words actually spoken in the clip — quote or closely paraphrase the transcript lines between your start and end timestamps. Do not invent events that are not in the transcript. Do not write a generic description.
- "reason": one sentence on why this specific moment will perform, referencing what is actually said in it.
