/** What can be opened from a link, and what has to be said when it cannot.
 *
 *  Mirrors `sources/dispatch.py` in the main repo, minus the platforms a
 *  browser cannot reach. The honest answer differs per platform and each one
 *  deserves its own sentence — "unsupported URL" tells someone nothing about
 *  what to do next, and the thing to do next is usually "download the app",
 *  which is the entire point of this page.
 *
 *  ## Why YouTube is not here
 *
 *  Not an oversight and not laziness. YouTube's video servers send no
 *  cross-origin headers, so a browser is physically unable to fetch from
 *  them — this is enforced by the browser, not by anything we could work
 *  around. The third-party "converter" sites are not an escape hatch either:
 *  they are websites rather than APIs, they are Cloudflare-fronted with no
 *  CORS headers of their own, break constantly, and would put somebody else's
 *  legal and advertising baggage on this domain.
 *
 *  What actually solves the real case: a creator clipping their OWN video can
 *  export it from YouTube Studio in two clicks and drop the file in here. So
 *  that is what we tell them.

/** Why Twitch is recognised but refused.
 *
 *  It was built and then removed, so this is worth stating precisely enough
 *  that nobody rebuilds it. The GraphQL token step works fine from a browser —
 *  `gql.twitch.tv` allows the origin and the `Client-ID` header. The failure
 *  is one step later: `usher.ttvnw.net` returns **no CORS headers at all on a
 *  successful response**, and neither does the CloudFront CDN behind it. The
 *  browser therefore refuses to hand the playlist to the page.
 *
 *  The trap is that Twitch DOES send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on
 *  error responses — a 403 for a nonexistent VOD looks permissive, which is
 *  what made this appear to work when it was checked against a made-up ID.
 *  Verify against a real VOD, or the errors lie to you.
 *
 *  Fixing it needs a proxy, which means a server, its bandwidth bill, and
 *  someone's name on the traffic. The desktop app already does this properly
 *  with yt-dlp. */
