# The Clips Kitty Whop app

A marketing surface that puts Clips Kitty in front of the people who would
use it: members of clipping communities on [Whop](https://whop.com), who cut
streamer VODs into vertical shorts and get paid per view.

**It is a set of pages, nothing more.** It does not process video, store
anything, talk to a member's PC, or connect to the Clips Kitty engine. The
desktop app has no idea this exists and works exactly the same without it.

## What it is

Whop embeds the app in an iframe and routes to three surfaces:

| Route | Who sees it | What it says |
|---|---|---|
| `/experiences/[experienceId]` | **members**, in the community sidebar | what Clips Kitty does, what their PC needs, the download, how it works, what it does not do |
| `/dashboard/[companyId]` | the **community owner**, in their dashboard | why it is worth recommending, what members need, and a message they can paste into their community |
| `/discover` | anyone browsing the **App Store** | the listing pitch |

Every claim on all three comes from [`lib/content.ts`](lib/content.ts), which
is the only place to edit copy. It is written against the main repo's
`README.md` and `site/`, so the app cannot quietly start promising something
the software does not do.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # starts Whop's dev proxy + next dev
```

`npm run dev` runs behind `whop-proxy`, which replicates the production
authentication and iframe behaviour. **The member and owner pages will not
render outside it** — they call `verifyUserToken` and fail closed without a
Whop-issued token. That is deliberate. `/discover` and `/` are static and
work anywhere.

### Environment

Two values, both from the app's page in the Whop dashboard. Put them in
`.env.local`, which is git-ignored:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=app_xxxxx
WHOP_API_KEY=xxxxx
```

There is **no webhook secret**, because there is no webhook route — Clips
Kitty is free, so there are no payments to be notified about. The
template's `/api/webhooks` handler was deleted rather than left as dead code
that fails the build without a key nobody needs.

`.env.development` is committed and holds **placeholders only**. Never put a
real key in it — it is tracked in a public repo, and `WHOP_API_KEY` acts as
your app.

`npm run build` needs `.env.local` to exist. `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID` is
inlined into the browser bundle at build time, so it has to be set *before*
the build, not after — the same is true of Vercel's environment variables.
The build failing on a missing value is deliberate: shipping a placeholder
would look fine until it reached a real community.

### Analytics

`<Analytics />` from `@vercel/analytics` is in the layout. It records page
views for this marketing page only — cookieless, no cross-site tracking, so
no consent banner is required, and it sends nothing at all until **Web
Analytics is switched on for the project** in the Vercel dashboard.

It says nothing about what anyone clips. The desktop app has no telemetry
and this does not change that.

### The pinned version

[`lib/content.ts`](lib/content.ts) has a `VERSION` constant and every
download link is built from it. **It is pinned on purpose.**

The Web Setup on GitHub is ~800 KB and fetches
`clips-studio-<version>-x64.nsis.7z` **by name** from the Hugging Face
release repo, because a GitHub release asset is capped at 2 GiB and the
payload is 5.88 GiB. Setup and payload are a matched pair. Bump `VERSION`
only once the new payload is live on Hugging Face, or everyone who clicks
gets a failed install.

## Deploying

Whop does not host anything — it stores a URL and renders it in an iframe.
Something has to serve the page, and that is Vercel's free tier here.

### Recommended: connect the GitHub repo

On vercel.com, **Add New → Project**, import `kaazzixd/kaazi-clips`, and
set:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Root Directory** | `whop-app` |
| Framework preset | Next.js (detected) |

**Root Directory is not optional.** The repository root is a Python and
Electron project; pointed at it, Vercel finds no Next.js app and the build
fails.

Every push to `main` then redeploys automatically, so shipping a new
`VERSION` is one commit. [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) carries an
`ignoreCommand` that skips the build when nothing under `whop-app/` changed
— without it, every commit to the Python engine, the docs or the website
would rebuild this app for no reason.

### Or deploy by hand

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Fine for a one-off, but then every future change needs remembering to run
it from the right machine.

Then in the Whop dashboard set the app's base URL to the deployment, and the
view paths to `/experiences/[experienceId]` and `/dashboard/[companyId]`.
Put both environment variables into Vercel's project settings — not into a
committed file — and set them **before** the first production build.

## Getting it in front of a community

1. Deploy, then install the app into your own test whop and click through
   both views.
2. **Share the install link directly with a community owner.** This works
   without an App Store listing, and is the fastest route to a specific
   community.
3. Submit to the App Store in parallel. It is free — Whop's marketplace fee
   is 0% — and reviewed in a few days. The bar is that the app works end to
   end in production without bugs.

## Editing the copy

Change [`lib/content.ts`](lib/content.ts). The three pages read from it, so
they cannot disagree with each other.

Two rules that matter more than they look:

- **Requirements go above the download button.** 16 GB of RAM is not a
  suggestion — on 8 GB the engine analyses an entire video and then fails at
  the render stage, which reads as a crash rather than a limit. Someone who
  learns that after a 5 GB download files a bug; someone who reads it first
  does not.
- **Do not add a claim that is not true of an installed build.** No cloud or
  external AI (Ollama only), no macOS, no live stream capture.
