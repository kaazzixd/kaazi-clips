/** An advisory "will this run on my PC?" hint.
 *
 *  Strictly a hint. Both signals it uses are unreliable — navigator.deviceMemory
 *  is capped at 8 and rounded to a power of two (so a 32 GB machine and a
 *  16 GB machine both report "8"), and the WebGL renderer string is masked
 *  in some browsers. So this NEVER blocks the download and never claims a
 *  machine is unsuitable; the worst it says is "we could not tell, here is
 *  what to check yourself".
 *
 *  It exists because the alternative is worse: someone on 8 GB downloads
 *  5 GB, processes a whole video, and gets nothing at the render stage.
