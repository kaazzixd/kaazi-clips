/** Every factual claim the app makes, in one place.
 *
 *  This app is marketing for software that runs on someone else's PC, which

 *  written fresh — README.md's Requirements and Supported platforms
 *  tables, and site/twitch.html's "What it does not do".

 *  cloud or external AI APIs (Ollama only), macOS, live stream capture,
 *  any hosted or multi-user service.

/** The version this app sends people to.
 *
 *  PINNED ON PURPOSE — do not change it to "whatever is newest".
 *
 *  The Web Setup on GitHub is only ~800 KB. During install it fetches
 *  `clips-studio-<version>-x64.nsis.7z` **by name** from the Hugging Face
 *  repo, because a GitHub release asset is capped at 2 GiB and the payload
 *  is 5.88 GiB. So the setup and the payload are a matched pair: pointing
 *  at a setup whose payload has not been uploaded yet gives every person
 *  who clicks a failed install.
 *
 *  When a new version ships, this changes ONLY after its payload is live on
 *  Hugging Face. See docs/RELEASING.md in the main repo.
 *
 *  Verified 2026-09-15: `clips-studio-1.2.0-x64.nsis.7z` is live on Hugging
 *  Face (6,156,604,703 bytes, size-checked against the local build), so the
 *  pin moves to 1.2.0. Not before — this app redeploys on push, so bumping it
 *  ahead of the upload puts a broken download in front of people within seconds.

Paste a Twitch, Kick or YouTube VOD and it finds the moments worth posting, crops them vertical with the speaker kept in frame, burns in word-synced captions and writes titles. No credits, no watermark, no subscription, and the video never leaves your machine.

Needs Windows and 16 GB of RAM (an NVIDIA GPU makes it much faster). Live streams are not supported — finished VODs only.
